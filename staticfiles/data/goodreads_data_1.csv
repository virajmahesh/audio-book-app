20000,33507,"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Extraordinary Voyages, #6)",Jules Verne,"When an unidentified “monster” threatens international shipping, French oceanographer Pierre Aronnax and his unflappable assistant Conseil join an expedition organized by the US Navy to hunt down and destroy the menace. After months of fruitless searching, they finally grapple with their quarry, but Aronnax, Conseil, and the brash Canadian harpooner Ned Land are thrown overboard in the attack, only to find that the “monster” is actually a futuristic submarine, the Nautilus, commanded by a shadowy, mystical, preternaturally imposing man who calls himself Captain Nemo. Thus begins a journey of 20,000 leagues—nearly 50,000 miles—that will take Captain Nemo, his crew, and these three adventurers on a journey of discovery through undersea forests, coral graveyards, miles-deep trenches, and even the sunken ruins of Atlantis. Jules Verne’s novel of undersea exploration has been captivating readers ever since its first publication in 1870, and Frederick Paul Walter’s reader-friendly, scientifically meticulous translation of this visionary science fiction classic is complete and unabridged down to the smallest substantive detail.",3.88,5:53125|4:66136|3:45583|2:10481|1:2717|total:178042,138757,3007,394,Barnes & Noble,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1494979127l/33507._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1494979127l/33507._SX50_.jpg,076072850X,9780760728505,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33507.Twenty_Thousand_Leagues_Under_the_Sea

20007,47842472,Lord George Bentinck: A Political Biography,Benjamin Disraeli,"Lord George Bentinck is an account of Disraeli's relation with his parliamentary colleague and friend. It is not simply an account of the battle over the Corn Laws with Sir Robert Peel, but a most remarkable book, extremely readable, and full of often quoted and apt comments and descriptions.<br /><br />Benjamin Disraeli, in full Benjamin Disraeli, earl of Beaconsfield, Viscount Hughenden of Hughenden, byname Dizzy, (born December 21, 1804, London, England--died April 19, 1881, London), British statesman and novelist who was twice prime minister (1868, 1874-80) and who provided the Conservative Party with a twofold policy of Tory democracy and imperialism.<br /> Disraeli was educated at small private schools. At the age of 17 he was articled to a firm of solicitors, but he longed to become notable in a more sensational manner. His first efforts were disastrous. In 1824 he speculated recklessly in South American mining shares, and, when he lost all a year later, he was left so badly in debt that he did not recover until well past middle age. Earlier he had persuaded the publisher John Murray, his father's friend, to launch a daily newspaper, the Representative. It was a complete failure. Disraeli, unable to pay his promised share of the capital, quarreled with Murray and others. Moreover, in his novel Vivian Grey (1826-27), published anonymously, he lampooned Murray while telling the story of the failure. Disraeli was unmasked as the author, and he was widely criticized.<br /> Disraeli suffered what would later be called a nervous breakdown and did little during the next four years. He wrote another extravagant novel, The Young Duke (1831), and in 1830 began 16 months of travel in the Mediterranean countries and the Middle East. These travels not only furnished him with material for Oriental descriptions he used in later novels but also influenced his attitude in foreign relations with India, Egypt, and Turkey in the 1870s.<br /> Back in England, he was active in London social and literary life, where his dandified dress, conceit and affectation, and exotic good looks made him a striking if not always popular figure. He was invited to fashionable parties and met most of the celebrities of the day. His novel Contarini Fleming (1832) has considerable autobiographical interest, like many of his novels, as well as echoes of his political thought.<br /> By 1831 Disraeli had decided to enter politics and sought a seat in Buckinghamshire, near Wycombe, where his family had settled. As an independent radical, he stood for and lost High Wycombe twice in 1832 and once in 1835. Realizing that he must attach himself to one of the political parties, he made a somewhat eccentric interpretation of Toryism, which some features of his radicalism fitted. In 1835 he unsuccessfully stood for Taunton as the official Conservative candidate. His extravagant behaviour, great debts, and open liaison with Henrietta, wife of Sir Francis Sykes (the prototype of the heroine in his novel Henrietta Temple [1837]), all gave him a dubious reputation. In 1837, however, he successfully stood for Maidstone in Kent as the Conservative candidate. His maiden speech in the House of Commons was a failure. Elaborate metaphors, affected mannerisms, and foppish dress led to his being shouted down. But he was not silenced. He concluded, defiantly and prophetically, ""I will sit down now, but the time will come when you will hear me.""",0.00,5:0|4:0|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:0,0,0,84,Lighthouse Books for Translation and Publishing,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1566268093l/47842472._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1566268093l/47842472._SX50_.jpg,0599622970,9780599622975,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/47842472-lord-george-bentinck

20009,7822763,Ixion in Heaven,Benjamin Disraeli,"Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield, KG, PC, FRS (born Benjamin DaIsraeli) (1804-1881) was a British Conservative statesman and literary figure. He served in government for three decades, twice as Prime Minister-the first and thus far only person of Jewish parentage to do so. Disraelias greatest lasting achievement was the creation of the modern Conservative Party after the Corn Laws schism of 1846. Before and during his political career, Disraeli was well-known as a literary and social figure, although his novels are not generally regarded as a part of the Victorian literary canon. He mainly wrote romances, of which Sybil; or, The Two Nations (1845) and Vivian Grey (1826-27) are perhaps the best-known today. After producing a Vindication of the English Constitution (1835), and some political pamphlets, Disraeli followed up Vivian Grey with a series of novels, The Young Duke (1831), Contarini Fleming (1832), Alroy (1833), Venetia and Henrietta Temple (1837). During the same period he had also written The Revolutionary Epick (1834) and three burlesques, Ixion in Heaven (1834), The Infernal Marriage (1834) and Popanilla (1828).",3.38,5:1|4:3|3:2|2:2|1:0|total:8,7,2,48,Dodo Press,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1409922030,9781409922032,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7822763-ixion-in-heaven

20073,5283566,Diophantine Analysis,Steuding Jorn,"While its roots reach back to the third century, diophantine analysis continues to be an extremely active and powerful area of number theory. Many diophantine problems have simple formulations, they can be extremely difficult to attack, and many open problems and conjectures remain.<br /><br />Diophantine Analysis examines the theory of diophantine approximations and the theory of diophantine equations, with emphasis on interactions between these subjects. Beginning with the basic principles, the author develops his treatment around the theory of continued fractions and examines the classic theory, including some of its applications. He also explores modern topics rarely addressed in other texts, including the abc conjecture, the polynomial Pell equation, and the irrationality of the zeta function and touches on topics and applications related to discrete mathematics, such as factoring methods for large integers.<br /><br />Setting the stage for tackling the field's many open problems and conjectures, Diophantine Analysis is an ideal introduction to the fundamentals of this venerable but still dynamic field. A detailed appendix supplies the necessary background material, more than 200 exercises reinforce the concepts, and engaging historical notes bring the subject to life.",4.00,5:0|4:1|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:1,1,1,261,CRC Press,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1356181769l/5283566._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1356181769l/5283566._SY75_.jpg,1584884827,9781584884828,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5283566-diophantine-analysis

20077,11563,Danse Macabre,Stephen King,"Before he gave us the “one of a kind classic” (The Wall Street Journal) memoir On Writing, Stephen King wrote a nonfiction masterpiece in Danse Macabre, “one of the best books on American popular culture” (Philadelphia Inquirer).<br /><br />From the author of dozens of #1 New York Times bestsellers and the creator of many unforgettable movies comes a vivid, intelligent, and nostalgic journey through three decades of horror as experienced through the eyes of the most popular writer in the genre. In 1981, years before he sat down to tackle On Writing, Stephen King decided to address the topic of what makes horror horrifying and what makes terror terrifying. Here, in ten brilliantly written chapters, King delivers one colorful observation after another about the great stories, books, and films that comprise the horror genre—from Frankenstein and Dracula to The Exorcist, The Twilight Zone, and Earth vs. The Flying Saucers.<br /><br />With the insight and good humor his fans appreciated in On Writing, Danse Macabre is an enjoyably entertaining tour through Stephen King’s beloved world of horror.",3.64,5:5413|4:7587|3:7604|2:2285|1:595|total:23484,20722,442,400,Berkley,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1309287093l/11563._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1309287093l/11563._SX50_.jpg,042518160X,9780425181607,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11563.Danse_Macabre

20101,48176,Under Fire,Henri Barbusse,"<b>Based on his own experience of the Great War, Henri Barbusse's novel is a powerful account of one of the greatest horrors mankind has ever inflicted on itself. </b><br /><br />For the group of ordinary men in the French Sixth Battalion, thrown together from all over France and longing for home, war is simply a matter of survival, lightened only by the arrival of their rations or a glimpse of a pretty girl or a brief reprieve in the hospital. Reminiscent of classics like Hemingway's <i>A Farewell to Arms</i> and Remarque's <i>All Quiet on the Western Front</i>, <i>Under Fire</i> (originally published in French as <i>La Feu</i>) vividly evokes life in the trenches: the mud, stench, and monotony of waiting while constantly fearing for one's life in an infernal and seemingly eternal battlefield.<br /><br />For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines.

No one, not the police, the FBI or the press can conjure any meaning or reason to his actions. <br /><br />When the eighth victim is found dead mere hours after visiting the renowned private investigator and solitary genius, Kendra Ryder, events and authorities bombard her beach house, leaving her no option but to put her mind to work.<br /><br />Only she and her dependable legman, Ader York, can possibly hope to reveal the true nature of the murders.

It came from the void and settled on Earth, striking awe into the hearts of all who saw it. Its mission, however, was not conquest -- but a call for help! First contact was a job for the brilliant team of scientists, Arcot, Wade, and Morey. And what they received was an offer of an alliance against an invading foe so powerful that no known force could turn it back!<br /><br />John W. Campbell's INVADERS FROM THE INFINITE is a veritable odyssey of the universe, exploring world after world and uncovering cosmic secret after cosmic secret. Here is a classic novel of super-science that may never be surpassed!",3.29,5:23|4:27|3:41|2:22|1:8|total:121,79,11,168,Wildside Press,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1434401049,9781434401045,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1271786.Invaders_from_the_Infinite

20157,32834842,"Call to Arms (Blood on the Stars, #2)",Jay Allan,"Call to Arms: Blood on the Stars II <br /> <br />War. The word spreads throughout the Confederation…the long-expected Union invasion has come. The enemy is strong, their fleets larger and more powerful than intelligence reports had predicted. They have broken through the forward defenses, sent the Confederation’s proud fleets into an ignominious retreat. <br /> <br />Captain Tyler Barron and the crew of the battleship Dauntless are lightyears from the front lines, at Archellia, waiting for their damaged battleship to be repaired. Their ship is only just operational, but there is no time. The Confederation forces need every reinforcement they can get, and Barron and his survivors board their vessel…and rush to the battle lines. <br /> <br />When they get there, they encounter nothing but fleeing ships and shattered fleets. The Confederation is losing the war, falling back steadily, yielding system after system to the invaders. The Union fleets continue inexorably forward, seemingly immune to the supply constraints that have bogged down past invasions. Dauntless finds herself trapped, cut off from the rest of the fleet along with another Confed battleship, and a trio of small escort vessels…deep behind the rapidly moving front lines. <br /> <br />Barron must make a choice. Pull back, try to find a way to get around the enemy and rejoin the fleet. Or press on, strike deep behind the enemy advance, an almost suicidal thrust toward the Union’s main logistical supply base…and the one way Tyler Barron can think of to buy the fleet the time it needs to regroup.

Although advised by his builders to substitute the common four-bladed propellers, he adhered to his original design, and with one propeller at either side of the rudder- called twin-propellers -she was soon ready for duty.

And the mercury shiver perpetually in the vicinity of zero! And every foot of earth be crusty-brown and bare with no white snow at all till the very last moment when you'd just about given up hope!

And one or two other oldish persons. But they all go away just as early in the narrative as I can manage it. Are obliged to go away! Yet lest you find in this general combination of circumstances some sinister threat of audacity, let me conventionalize the story at once by opening it at that most conventional of all conventional Christmas-story hours, - the Twilight of Christmas Eve. Nuff said? - Christmas Eve, you remember? Twilight? Awfully cold weather? And somebody very young? Now for the story itself! <br /><br />After five blustering, wintry weeks of village speculation and gossip there was of course considerable satisfaction in being the first to solve the mysterious holiday tenancy of the Rattle-Pane House. Breathless with excitement Flame Nourice telephoned the news from the village post-office. <br /><br />From a pedestal of boxes fairly bulging with red-wheeled go-carts, one keen young elbow rammed for balance into a gay glassy shelf of stick-candy, green tissue garlands tickling across her cheek, she sped the message to her mother. <br /><br />""O Mother-Funny!"" triumphed Flame. ""I've found out who's Christmasing at the Rattle-Pane House! It's a red-haired setter dog with one black ear! And he's sitting at the front gate this moment! Superintending the unpacking of the furniture van! And I've named him Lopsy!"" <br /><br />""Why, Flame; how absurd!"" gasped her mother.

20220,19162150,The Mind and Its Education,George Herbert Betts,"Excerpt from The Mind and Its Education <br />This book is intended as an introduction to psychology for teachers, both in their private study and their Reading Circle classes, for students in secondary schools, normal schools or colleges, and for general readers. Its appearance is an immediate outgrowth of various courses of lectures on psychology and education given to teachers and elementary students in education. More remotely, it owes its origin to a suggestion received from Prof. John Dewey when the writer was a student in his classes. Said Professor Dewey: ""The teacher is equally under the necessity of knowing each of the two factors in the educational process - culture and the child; that is, subject-matter and psychology - not the technicalities and controversial points of psychology, but its broad and fundamental truths, upon which practically all are agreed, and which, fortunately, are simple and easily understood."" This statement furnishes the standpoint, in the following pages, for both subject-matter and method of treatment. <br />First, the attempt has been made to present only fundamental truths, which, let us be thankful, are but little subject to controversy. <br />About the Publisher <br />Forgotten Books publishes hundreds of thousands of rare and classic books.

The actors speak Shakespeare's words--but with their own American accents.<br /><br /><br />Readers can now experience this new vision of Shakespeare's violent, tragic play alongside the Bard<br />s original text, in a special single volume that features an introduction by the film's director.",3.74,5:562651|4:588979|3:509356|2:172271|1:66711|total:1899968,133,7,320,Laurel Leaf Library,en-US,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,0440227127,9780440227120,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/245136.Romeo_Juliet

Ceci s'adressait a une grande jeune femme mince, vetue de blanc et qui semblait un long boa souple depose dans un fauteuil. -Vous croyez? fit-elle, surprise; et elle tendit ses bras en avant, les etira et les passa sous sa nuque lisse.-Vraiment, Bien-Aime, vous me faites tort; je suis seulement un peu fatiguee depuis quelque temps. -Oui, oui, nous savons: les domestiques, la nouvelle cuisiniere, les toiles d'araignees... sans compter vos trottes insensees sur les routes, sous pretexte d'abattre vos nerfs... mais je les aime moi, vos nerfs, quelquefois!... seulement... -Seulement? Avertie glissa un il inquiet vers le beau garcon qui venait de parler. Comme elle l'aimait! Comme il repondait a tous ses gouts! Elle avait toujours peur de lui deplaire et elle sentait pourtant qu'il lui serait tout a fait impossible, ce jour-la, de simuler un etat d'ame. -Oui, oui, reprit-il, il vous faut voyager. S'agenouillant a ses pieds, il glissa ses bras autour de son grand corps flexible et la regarda ardemment. -Vos yeux sont paisibles, votre bouche sans desirs. Bientot vous serez la petite chose inerte et je ne vous aimerai plus! La vanite de cette menace la fit rire franchement; elle l'embrassa sur le front. Il etait tard. Avertie monta dans sa chambre et peu apres vint prendre place aux cotes du Bien-Aime, dans le grand lit a colonnes torses, encadre de rideaux cramoisis. Alors, elle jeta un regard circulaire sur la vaste piece qu'elle avait arrangee avec tant de soins et un gout si precis. Sa pensee traina et s'alanguit devant un panneau d'Hubert Robert representant des jardins d'Italie; puis son il glissa sur deux petits Canaletto ou Venise en fete, toute doree, offrait ses charmes, et sur le beau garcon qu'elle avait pres d'elle. Elle le regarda comme elle venait de regarder ses tableaux, avec la meme complaisance. Son eurythmie l'enchanta. Il lui plaisait a l'egal d'un beau paysage; c'etait l'expression absolue de son type. Et pourtant elle se sentit la petite chose inerte! -Oui. B.-A. Vous avez raison; j'ai besoin de voyager. Et... j'irai en Italie....

Her shoulders were framed in her cloak, white as marble warmed with firelight. Her gloved hands held an opera glass which also glowed with flashing light. <br />His face grew dark and stern. He looked down at his poor coat and around at the motley gallery which reeked with the smell of tobacco and liquor. <br />Students were there - poor like himself, but with great music-loving, hungry, ambitious souls. Men and women of refinement and indomitable will sat side by side with drunken loafers who had chanced to stumble up the stairway. <br />His eyes went back to her. So sweet and dainty was every thread on her fair body. No smell of toil, nor touch of care, nor mark of weariness. Her flesh was ivory, her eyes were jewels, her heart was as clean and sweet as her eyes.

In 1862 his picture The Lady of Shalott was exhibited at the Royal Academy, but the Academy steadily refused his maturer work; and after the opening of the Grosvenor Gallery in 1877 he ceased to send pictures to Burlington House. In 1864 he began to illustrate a series of sixpenny toy-books of nursery rhymes in three colours for Edmund Evans. He was allowed more freedom in a series beginning with The Frog Prince (1874) which showed markedly the influence of Japanese art, and of a long visit to Italy following his marriage in 1871. From the early 1880s, Crane was closely associated with the Socialist movement. He provided the weekly cartoons for the Socialist Organs Justice, The Commonweal and The Clarion. One of his last major works would be his Lunettes at the Royal West of England Academy which were painted in 1913.",4.09,5:10|4:6|3:4|2:2|1:0|total:22,11,2,88,Dodo Press,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1409911578,9781409911579,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6125277-the-baby-s-own-aesop

His observation rings true: Urban legends, conspiracy theories, and bogus news stories circulate effortlessly. Meanwhile, people with important ideas--entrepreneurs, teachers, politicians, and journalists--struggle to make them ""stick.""<br /><br />In <i>Made to Stick</i>, Chip and Dan Heath reveal the anatomy of ideas that stick and explain ways to make ideas stickier, such as applying the human scale principle, using the Velcro Theory of Memory, and creating curiosity gaps. Along the way, we discover that sticky messages of all kinds--from the infamous ""kidney theft ring"" hoax to a coach's lessons on sportsmanship to a vision for a new product at Sony--draw their power from the same six traits.<br /><br /><i>Made to Stick</i> will transform the way you communicate. It's a fast-paced tour of success stories (and failures): the Nobel Prize-winning scientist who drank a glass of bacteria to prove a point about stomach ulcers; the charities who make use of the Mother Teresa Effect; the elementary-school teacher whose simulation actually prevented racial prejudice.<br /><br />Provocative, eye-opening, and often surprisingly funny, <i>Made to Stick</i> shows us the vital principles of winning ideas--and tells us how we can apply these rules to making our own messages stick.",3.95,5:23207|4:23698|3:13015|2:3576|1:2169|total:65665,62887,2243,291,Random House,eng,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1400064287,9781400064281,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/69242.Made_to_Stick

20343,20593731,The Spinners' Book of Fiction,Spinners' Club,"Wherefore this book of fiction by Californian writers? And why its appeal otherwise than that of obvious esthetic and literary qualities? They who read what follows will know. The fund, which the sale of this book is purposed to aid, was planned by The Spinners soon after the eighteenth of April, 1906, and was started with two hundred dollars from their treasury. To this, Mrs. Gertrude Atherton added another two hundred dollars. Several women's clubs and private individuals also generously responded, so that now there is a thousand dollars to the credit of the fund. A bond has been bought and the interest from it will be paid to Ina D. Coolbrith, the poet, and first chosen beneficiary of the fund. The Spinners feel assured that this book will meet with such a ready sale as to make possible the purchase of several bonds, and so render the accruing interest a steady source of aid to Miss. Coolbrith. All who have read and fallen under the charm of her ""Songs from the Golden Gate,"" or felt the beauty and tenderness of the verses ""When the Grass Shall Cover Me,"" will, without question, unite in making ""assurance doubly sure"" to such end. From the days of the old Overland Monthly, when she worked side by side with Bret Harte and Charles Warren Stoddard, to the present moment, Miss. Coolbrith's name has formed a part of the literary history of San Francisco. The eighteenth of April, 1906, and the night which followed it, left her bereft of all literary, and other, treasures; but her poem bearing the refrain, ""Lost city of my love and my desire,"" rings with the old genius, and expresses the feeling of many made desolate by the destruction of the city which held their most cherished memories.

When she begins spending more time in town, she is surrounded by women -- her mother, an agnostic, opinionated woman who sells encyclopedias to local farmers; her mother's boarder, the lusty Fern Dogherty; and her best friend, Naomi, with whom she shares the frustrations and unbridled glee of adolescence.<br /><br />Through these unwitting mentors and in her own encounters with sex, birth, and death, Del explores the dark and bright sides of womanhood. All along she remains a wise, witty observer and recorder of truths in small-town life. The result is a powerful, moving, and humorous demonstration of Alice Munro's unparalleled awareness of the lives of girls and women.",3.99,5:3425|4:3859|3:2065|2:501|1:159|total:10009,8303,541,277,Vintage,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320391660l/14285._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320391660l/14285._SY75_.jpg,0375707492,9780375707490,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14285.Lives_of_Girls_and_Women

Lichtenberg, a genial Anglophile, physicist, and colleague of Goethe, brought all the scabrous and mordant detail of Hogarth’s masterpieces to life. The brilliant translation by Arthur Wensinger is accompanied by an introduction and thorough notes, and by two other important early texts: Rouquet’s commentaries, which were authorized by Hogarth, and a hudibrastic verse explanation published in 1746. The very full illustration includes the Riephenhausen engravings from which Lichtenberg worked, Hogarth’s own engravings, and extensive details.",0.00,5:0|4:0|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:0,0,0,224,Pallas Athene,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1356484021l/2783621._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1356484021l/2783621._SX50_.jpg,1843680270,9781843680277,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2783621-hogarth-on-high-life

20389,62666,American Power and the New Mandarins: Historical and Political Essays,Noam Chomsky,"<i>American Power and the New Mandarins</i> is Noam Chomsky’s first political book, widely considered to be among the most cogent and powerful statements against the American war in Vietnam. Long out of print, this collection of early, seminal essays helped to establish Chomsky as a leading critic of United States foreign policy. These pages mount a scathing critique of the contradictions of the war, and an indictment of the mainstream, liberal intellectuals—the “new mandarins”—who furnished what Chomsky argued was the necessary ideological cover for the horrors visited on the Vietnamese people.<br /><br />As America’s foreign entanglements deepen by the month, Chomsky’s lucid analysis is a sobering reminder of the perils of imperial diplomacy. With a new foreword by Howard Zinn, author of <i>A People’s History of the United States</i>, <i>American Power and the New Mandarins</i> is a renewed call for independent analysis of America’s role in the world.<br /><br /><br />",4.15,5:156|4:138|3:55|2:14|1:6|total:369,350,13,432,New Press,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328752580l/62666._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328752580l/62666._SX50_.jpg,156584775X,9781565847750,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62666.American_Power_and_the_New_Mandarins

After a number of meaningless conquests, he at last encounters Ellenore, a beautiful and passionate older woman. Adolphe is enraptured and gradually wears down her resistance to his declarations of love. But as they embark on an intense and tortured affair, Ellenore gives way to a flood of emotion that only serves to repel her younger lover - yet he cannot bring himself to leave her and his procrastination can only bring tragedy. Partly inspired by Constant's own stormy affair with Madame de Staël, <i>Adolphe</i> (1816) is a penetrating psychological depiction of love that plumbs the depths of the passions, motives and inconsistencies of the human character.",3.55,5:359|4:558|3:582|2:208|1:53|total:1760,1119,68,128,Penguin Classics,eng,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,0140441344,9780140441345,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/455696.Adolphe

Washington, however, already had shown a love of leisure that was not wholly in keeping with his further recommendation for activity, and, instead of assisting the girls of the Overland unit to unload their ponies, the boy sat perched on the pack mule that he had been riding, playing a harmonica, swaying in his saddle in rhythm with the music, and rolling the whites of his eyes in ecstasy.",2.83,5:1|4:0|3:2|2:3|1:0|total:6,1,0,154,Book Jungle,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1438519710,9781438519715,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7049462-grace-harlowe-s-overland-riders-among-the-kentucky-mountaineers

The year is 878 and Wessex is free from the Vikings. Uhtred, the dispossessed son of a Northumbrian lord, helped Alfred win that victory, but now he is disgusted by Alfred's lack of generosity and repelled by the king's insistent piety. He flees Wessex, going back north to seek revenge for the killing of his foster father and to rescue his stepsister, captured in the same raid. He needs to find his old enemy, Kjartan, a renegade Danish lord who lurks in the formidable stronghold of Dunholm. Uhtred arrives in the north to discover rebellion, chaos and fear. His only ally is Hild, a West Saxon nun fleeing her calling, and his best hope is his sword, with which he has made a formidable reputation as a warrior. He will need the assistance of other warriors if he is to attack Dunholm and he finds Guthred, a slave who believes he is a king. He takes him across the Pennines to where a desperate alliance of fanatical Christians and beleaguered Danes form a new army to confront the terrible Viking lords who rule Northumbria.

Her hands lightly caught the molding on either side of the door. She was looking intently into the mirror at the other end of the hall. All the lights in the dining-room were lit, and she saw herself rather keenly set against their brilliance. The straight-held head, the lifted arms, the short, slender waist, the long, long sweep of her skirts made her seem taller than she actually was; and the strong, bright growth of her hair and the vivacity of her face made her seem more deeply colored. <br />She had poised there for the mere survey of a new gown, but after a moment of dwelling on her own reflection she found herself considering it only as an object in the foreground of a picture. That picture, seen through the open door, reflected in the glass, was all of a bright, hard glitter, all a high, harsh tone of newness.

20448,8770402,The Wit of a Duck and Other Papers,John Burroughs,"John Burroughs (1837-1921) was an American naturalist and essayist. He played an important role in the evolution of the U. S. conservation movement. According to biographers at the American Memory project at the Library of Congress, John Burroughs was the most important practitioner after Thoreau of that especially American literary genre, the nature essay. By the turn of the century he had become a virtual cultural institution in his own right: the Grand Old Man of Nature at a time when the American romance with the idea of nature, and the American conservation movement, had come fully into their own. His extraordinary popularity and popular visibility were sustained by a prolific stream of essay collections, beginning with Wake-Robin in 1871. In the words of his biographer Edward Renehan, Burroughs's special identity was less that of a scientific naturalist than that of ""a literary naturalist with a duty to record his own unique perceptions of the natural world. "" His most famous works include: Winter Sunshine (1875), Locusts and Wild Honey (1879), The Writings of John Burroughs (1895) and Far and Near (1904).",2.83,5:1|4:1|3:1|2:2|1:1|total:6,3,1,72,Dodo Press,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1406590177,9781406590173,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8770402-the-wit-of-a-duck-and-other-papers

But seventeen-year-old domestic Christine knows there is a whole world waiting beyond her small German village. It’s a world she’s begun to glimpse through music, books—and through Isaac Bauerman, the cultured son of the wealthy Jewish family she works for.<br /> <br />Yet the future she and Isaac dream of sharing faces greater challenges than their difference in stations. In the fall of 1938, Germany is changing rapidly under Hitler’s regime. Anti-Jewish posters are everywhere, dissenting talk is silenced, and a new law forbids Christine from returning to her job—and from having any relationship with Isaac. In the months and years that follow, Christine will confront the Gestapo’s wrath and the horrors of Dachau, desperate to be with the man she loves, to survive—and finally, to speak out. <br /> <br />Set against the backdrop of the German home front, this is an unforgettable novel of courage and resolve, of the inhumanity of war, and the heartbreak and hope left in its wake.",4.03,5:4808|4:5487|3:2576|2:609|1:189|total:13669,10522,1264,400,Kensington,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1339438508l/13333093._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1339438508l/13333093._SX50_.jpg,0758278438,9780758278432,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13333093-the-plum-tree

20516,780882,"A Christmas Journey (Christmas Stories, #1)",Anne Perry,"Readers of Anne Perry’s bestselling suspense novels revel in a world that is all their own, sharing the privileged existence of Britain’s wealthy and powerful elite in West End mansions and great country houses. It is also a world in which danger bides in unsuspected places and the line between good and evil can be razor thin. This new novel features Lady Vespasia Cumming-Gould–one of the most memorable characters from the Thomas Pitt series–who appears here as a lively young woman, the ultimate aristocrat who can trace her blood to half the royal houses of Europe.<br /><br />It’s Christmas and the Berkshire countryside lies wrapped in winter chill. But the well-born guests who have gathered at Applecross for a delicious weekend of innocent intrigue and passionate romance are warmed by roaring fires and candlelight, holly and mistletoe, good wine and gorgeously wrapped gifts. It’s scarcely the setting for misfortune, and no one–not even that clever young aristocrat and budding sleuth Vespasia Cumming-Gould–anticipates the tragedy that is to darken this light-hearted holiday house party. But soon one young woman lies dead, a suicide, and another is ostracized, held partly responsible for the shocking turn of events.<br /><br />To expiate her guilt, Gwendolen Kilmuir sets out for the Scottish Highlands, hoping to explain to the dead girl’s mother the circumstances surrounding the sorrowful act–and to bring her back to England for the funeral. Gwendolen’s sole companion on this nightmarish journey is Vespasia. As Vespasia learns more about the victim and the ugly forces that shaped her desperate deed, she understands the heartbreaking truth of the tragedy.",3.37,5:321|4:676|3:914|2:288|1:90|total:2289,1999,250,180,Ballantine Books,eng,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,034546673X,9780345466730,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/780882.A_Christmas_Journey

But Steve's search for his missing sweetheart brought him to the threshold of one of the greatest secrets of all time. And it was obvious that somebody would stop at nothing to keep him from uncovering it.<br /><br />What were the oddly sinister symbols along otherwise ordinary roads? What was behind the spreading plague called Mekstrom's Disease? Why were there ""blank"" spots where telepathy didn't work? Who was the elusive enemy with powers even beyond those ESP had bestowed on mankind?<br /><br />And, most important of all . . . could Steve find that enemy before they made him vanish too?<br /><br />And then it came to him that what he really wanted was to possess a body of Mekstrom Flesh, to be a physical superman. . . .",3.67,5:13|4:19|3:12|2:6|1:2|total:52,29,6,196,Aegypan,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1603122052,9781603122054,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2504739.Highways_in_Hiding

Here are the stories of the creation of mind and matter; of the origin of Death, of the first sexual union and the first parricide. We learn why Siva must carry his father's skull, why snakes have forked tongues, and why, as part of a certain sacrifice, the king's wife must copulate with a dead horse.

20523,9336732,Religion and Art in Ancient Greece,Ernest Gardner,"pubOne.info present you this wonderfully illustrated edition. Greek religion may be studied under various aspects; and many recent contributions to this study have been mainly concerned either with the remote origin of many of its ceremonies in primitive ritual, or with the manner in which some of its obscurer manifestations met the deeper spiritual needs which did not find satisfaction in the official cults. Such discussions are of the highest interest to the anthropologist and to the psychologist; but they have the disadvantage of fixing our attention too exclusively on what, to the ordinary Greek, appeared accidental or even morbid, and of making us regard the Olympian pantheon, with its clearly realised figures of the gods, as a mere system imposed more or less from outside upon the old rites and beliefs of the people. In the province of art, at least, the Olympian gods are paramount; and thus we are led to appreciate and to understand their worship as it affected the religious ideals of the people and the services of the State. For we must remember that in the case of religion even more than in that of art, its essential character and its influence upon life and thought lie rather in its full perfection than in its origin.",3.60,5:2|4:3|3:4|2:1|1:0|total:10,6,0,,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9336732-religion-and-art-in-ancient-greece

20528,6207606,Round About a Great Estate,Richard Jefferies,"John Richard Jefferies was an English nature writer, essayist and journalist. He wrote fiction mainly based on farming and rural life. From early in life he showed a great love of the countryside, but was temperamentally unsuited to follow his father as a farmer, and in 1866 he found employment as a newspaper reporter for the North Wiltshire Herald and the Swindon Advertiser. In late 1877 he moved to Surbiton to be nearer the hub of literary England. His new surroundings defined him, as a country writer. Articles drawing on Jefferies' Wiltshire experiences were snapped up by the Pall Mall Gazette, to be followed by similar collections of essays, like Round About a Great Estate (1880). About this time he wrote his extraordinary autobiography, The Story of My Heart: An Autobiography (1883).",3.67,5:4|4:1|3:2|2:1|1:1|total:9,6,0,118,Ex Libris,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1426562777l/6207606._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1426562777l/6207606._SY75_.jpg,0948578106,9780948578106,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6207606-round-about-a-great-estate

20537,22929741,The Argonauts,Maggie Nelson,"An intrepid voyage out to the frontiers of the latest thinking about love, language, and family.<br /><br />Maggie Nelson's The Argonauts is a genre-bending memoir, a work of ""autotheory"" offering fresh, fierce, and timely thinking about desire, identity, and the limitations and possibilities of love and language. At its center is a romance: the story of the author's relationship with the artist Harry Dodge. This story, which includes Nelson's account of falling in love with Dodge, who is fluidly gendered, as well as her journey to and through a pregnancy, offers a firsthand account of the complexities and joys of (queer) family-making.<br /><br />Writing in the spirit of public intellectuals such as Susan Sontag and Roland Barthes, Nelson binds her personal experience to a rigorous exploration of what iconic theorists have said about sexuality, gender, and the vexed institutions of marriage and child-rearing. Nelson's insistence on radical individual freedom and the value of caretaking becomes the rallying cry of this thoughtful, unabashed, uncompromising book.",4.03,5:9573|4:8074|3:4163|2:1399|1:619|total:23828,20440,2070,160,Graywolf Press,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1410981835l/22929741._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1410981835l/22929741._SX50_.jpg,1555977073,9781555977078,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22929741-the-argonauts

Known as ""Soapy Sam""; he was one of the greatest public speakers of his day. He is probably best remembered today for his opposition to Charles Darwin's theory of evolution - most notably at a legendary debate in 1860. In 1830, he was presented by Charles Sumner, Bishop of Winchester to the rectory of Brighstone in the Isle of Wight. At the close of 1837 he published the <i>Letters and Journals of Henry Martyn</i>. In 1839 he also published <i>Eucharistica</i> (from the old English divines), to which he wrote an introduction, <i>Agathos and Other Sunday Stories</i>, and a volume of University Sermons, and in the following year <i>Rocky Island and Other Parables</i>. In 1841, he was chosen Bampton lecturer, and shortly afterwards made chaplain to Prince Albert. In 1843, he was appointed by the archbishop of York to be sub-almoner to the Queen. In 1844 his <i>A History of the Protestant Episcopal Church</i> in America appeared. In 1854, he opened a theological college at Cuddesdon, now known as Ripon College (Cuddesdon).",0.00,5:0|4:0|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:0,0,0,88,Dodo Press,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1409956253,9781409956259,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8510080-the-rocky-island-and-other-similitudes

At their feet, the waters of Cayuga Lake dimpled under the rays of the western sun. Like a strip of burnished silver, the inlet wound its way through the swamp from the elevators and railroad stations near the foot of south hill. Across the lake rose the precipitous slopes of East Hill, tapestried in green, etched here and there by stretches of winding white road, and crowned by the buildings on the campus of Cornell University. Stretched from the foot of State Street on either side of the Lehigh Valley track lay the Silent City, its northern end spreading several miles up the west shore of the Lake. Its inhabitants were canalers, fishermen and hunters, uneducated, rough and superstitious. They built their little huts in the simplest manner out of packing boxes and rough lumber and roofed them with pieces of tin and sheet iron.

20555,8724862,What Is and What Might Be A Study of Education in General and Elementary Education in Particular,Edmond Holmes,"pubOne.info present you this new edition. My aim, in writing this book, is to show that the externalism of the West, the prevalent tendency to pay undue regard to outward and visible ""results"" and to neglect what is inward and vital, is the source of most of the defects that vitiate Education in this country, and therefore that the only remedy for those defects is the drastic one of changing our standard of reality and our conception of the meaning and value of life. My reason for making a special study of that branch of education which is known as ""Elementary, "" is that I happen to have a more intimate knowledge of it than of any other branch, the inside of an elementary school being so familiar to me that I can in some degree bring the eye of experience to bear upon the problems that confront its teachers. I do not for a moment imagine that the elementary school teacher is more deeply tainted than his fellows with the virus of ""Occidentalism.

20560,13236515,Letters to His Friends and Family,Pier Giorgio Frassati,"""So what did he do to become a saint? What miracles did he work?"" These are the questions one often hears about the life of Pier Giorgio Frassati. For Catholics who associate sainthood with miracles and spiritual phenomena, the story of a young man who lived an ordinary life seems rather... well, ordinary. And at first glance, that is what it was: days that revolved around a routine of home, school and friends; weekends spent skiing in the mountains or swimming at the beach. Many of Pier Giorgio s letters and postcards are filled with the humdrum recitation of details concerning exams taken, tourist sites visited, trains missed, and even greetings to the family pets. His was a life like millions of others, even like ours: it was very ordinary. Or was it? <br /><br />From the first letter written to his father at the age of five, to the last reminder to a friend scrawled with a paralyzed hand as he lay on his deathbed at the age of twenty-four, Pier Giorgio s strong faith shines forth brightly. The child's promise that ""I'll pray to Baby Jesus for you"" grows throughout the years into a crescendo of blessing and spiritual encouragements until it reaches a shout of ""Long life Christ the King!"" in manhood. <br /><br />Frequent references Siena intermingle with his own thoughts about peace, prayer, friendship, charity, family life on each and life with God forever in Heaven. His personal mission to the poor is his fervent love of country and his hatred for tyranny and injustice. <br /><br />Pier Giorgio was a prophet, and more than that: he was a saint. And in these Letters, he shows us that it is possible for us to become saints, too. <br />Fr. Timothy E.

20588,20448615,"Exploring the Island (The Wonder Island Boys, #2)",Roger Thompson Finlay,"""I wonder why the yaks are so wild and difficult to handle this morning?"" said George, as he stopped the wagon and tried to calm them by soothing words. At that moment Harry, who was in the lead, sprang back with a cry of alarm, and quietly, but with-evident excitement, whispered: ""There are some big animals over to the right!"" The Professor was out of the wagon in an instant and moved forward with Harry. ""You would better remain with the team, George,"" was the Professor's suggestion. George Mayfield and Harry Crandall, two American boys, attached to a ship training school, had been shipwrecked, in company with an aged professor, on an unknown island, somewhere in the Pacific, over four months prior to the opening of this chapter; and, after a series of adventures, had been able, by ingenious means, to devise many of the necessaries of life from the crude materials which nature furnished them; and they were now on their third voyage of discovery into the unknown land. For your information, a brief outline is given of a few of the things they had discovered, of some of their adventures, and of what they had made, and why they were now far out in the wilderness.",0.00,5:0|4:0|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:0,0,0,,,eng,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20448615-exploring-the-island

One hundred years after his release from Reading Gaol, the life and work of Oscar Wilde has lost none of its fascination. In his day, his wit and writings enchanted and scandalized society in equal measure; his downfall came at the height of his powers. Devastated by his notorious trial for indecency, imprisoned for ``homosexual offenses,'' he was to spend two ruinous years in solitary confinement. As he was later to tell Andre Gide, Reading Gaol ``was not fit for dogs. I thought I would go mad.'' The Ballad was written from personal experience, and there was to be no more writing after this. As Wilde observed: ``Something is killed in me.'' Bankrupt, disgraced, and in exile, Wilde was to die not long after his release at the age of 46. His final resting place is the cemetery of Pere Lachaise in Paris. His tomb bears an inscription from The Ballad of Reading Gaol: ``And alien tears will fill for him/Pity's long broken urn/For his mourners will be outcast men/And outcasts always mourn.''

20606,15808242,"City of Dark Magic (City of Dark Magic, #1)",Magnus Flyte,"<b>Cosmically fast-paced and wildly imaginative, this debut novel is a perfect potion of magic and suspense<br /></b><br /> Once a city of enormous wealth and culture, Prague was home to emperors, alchemists, astronomers, and, as it’s whispered, hell portals. When music student Sarah Weston lands a summer job at Prague Castle cataloging Beethoven’s manuscripts, she has no idea how dangerous her life is about to become. <i>Prague is a threshold, </i>Sarah is warned, <i>and it is steeped in blood.<br /></i>      Soon after Sarah arrives, strange things begin to happen. She learns that her mentor, who was working at the castle, may not have committed suicide after all. Could his cryptic notes be warnings? As Sarah parses his clues about Beethoven’s “Immortal Beloved,” she manages to get arrested, to have tantric sex in a public fountain, and to discover a time-warping drug. She also catches the attention of a four-hundred-year-old dwarf, the handsome Prince Max, and a powerful U.S. senator with secrets she will do anything to hide.<br />      <i>City of Dark Magic </i>could be called a rom-com paranormal suspense novel—or it could simply be called one of the most entertaining novels of the year.",3.47,5:1705|4:3424|3:3130|2:1225|1:453|total:9937,9262,1533,464,Penguin Books/Penguin Random House,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348424640l/15808242._SY160_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348424640l/15808242._SY75_.jpg,0143122681,9780143122685,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15808242-city-of-dark-magic
20607,7096123,"The Rembrandt Affair (Gabriel Allon, #10)",Daniel Silva,"<b>
  <i>Two families, one terrible secret, and a painting to die for ... </i>
</b> <br /><br /> Determined to sever his ties with the Office, Gabriel Allon has retreated to the windswept cliffs of Cornwall with his beautiful Venetian-born wife Chiara. But once again his seclusion is interrupted by a visitor from his tangled past: the endearingly eccentric London art dealer, Julian Isherwood. As usual, Isherwood has a problem. And it is one only Gabriel can solve. <br /><br /> In the ancient English city of Glastonbury, an art restorer has been brutally murdered and a long-lost portrait by Rembrandt mysteriously stolen. Despite his reluctance, Gabriel is persuaded to use his unique skills to search for the painting and those responsible for the crime. But as he painstakingly follows a trail of clues leading from Amsterdam to Buenos Aires and, finally, to a villa on the graceful shores of Lake Geneva, Gabriel discovers there are deadly secrets connected to the painting. And evil men behind them. <br /><br /> Before he is done, Gabriel will once again be drawn into a world he thought he had left behind forever, and will come face to face with a remarkable cast of characters: a glamorous London journalist who is determined to undo the worst mistake of her career, an elusive master art thief who is burdened by a conscience, and a powerful Swiss billionaire who is known for his good deeds but may just be behind one of the greatest threats facing the world. <br />",4.28,5:11962|4:10464|3:3312|2:376|1:149|total:26263,21835,1127,484,G.P.

20616,22224137,The Old Front Line: The Centenary of the Western Front in Pictures,Stephen Bull,"Now that the last veterans are gone, the First World War is now a completely historical subject governed by archaeology and genealogy, battlefield tourism and military history. The anguish and privations are a bit further away, but there is still huge interest in the awful conditions and carnage endured by a generation of youth who sacrificed their lives for their country. The Old Front Line is a phrase first coined by the poet John Masefield when he looked back on the battle of the Somme from a distance of just one year, in 1917, and speculated how the Western Front might look in the future. Stephen Bull s copiously illustrated work part travel guide, part popular history a century on, answers his speculations. The main source material is new and contemporary photographs, as well as some from the intervening century. Taken together these provide a series of exciting vistas and informative details that tell the story of the battles and landscapes. Aerial photography, old and new ground shots and in a few cases even images taken underground provide an authoritative summary of the war on the Western Front. Following an introduction that sets the scene and looks at the early stages of the war, eight chapters examine the Western Front geographically, looking closely at the main areas of fighting and what is visible today: not just the iron harvest the scars left by trench and battle but also the cemeteries, war memorials and statues that remind the visitor starkly of the loss of a generation.REVIEWS "" magnificent looks not only at the ""iron harvest"" but also at the scars of battle, preserved trenches and dugouts, and cemeteries and memorials, all of which remind the visitor of the carnage of four years of industrial warfare narrative takes the reader through these four years providing details necessary to compliment the photos and expand the readers understanding.World War I Historical Association.."".makes the reader pause to consider how sites that once witnessed so much death and destruction have become so beautiful today""Journal of America's Military Past""",4.44,5:6|4:1|3:2|2:0|1:0|total:9,9,1,192,Casemate Publishers and Book Distributors,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1410803701l/22224137._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1410803701l/22224137._SX50_.jpg,1612002307,9781612002309,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22224137-the-old-front-line

Together they make a thousand chandeliers. All except Torchy. When he turns on his light it suddenly becomes as bright as day. Thinking that it's morning, baby birds cry out to be fed and earthworms scramble for cover. Torchy's bright light ruins the fireflies' fun and all the forest animals are angry with him for disturbing their sleep. Torchy goes off to be alone and, in the course of his adventures, discovers that there are all kinds of lights in the world. First published in 1970, A Firefly Named Torchy continues to entertain. Bernard Waber uses light and dark and shimmering colors to create a stunning picture book that truly conveys the motion and sparkle of the firefly world.

These wonderful and comical tales will appeal to fans of Leacock's work, and would make for worthy additions to any literary collection. The stories of this compendium include: ""Thrown on the World,"" ""A Re-encounter,"" ""Friends in Distress,"" ""A Gambling Party in St. James's Close,"" ""The Abduction,"" ""The Unknown,"" ""The Proposal,"" ""Wedded at Last,"" ""John and I; Or, How I Nearly Lost my Husband,"" and more. Stephen P. H. Butler Leacock (1869 - 1944) was a Canadian writer, humourist, and teacher. He was amongst the most widely read English-speaking authors in the world during the early-twentieth century, and is best remembered for his humourous novels. Many vintage texts such as this are increasingly scarce and expensive, and it is with this in mind that we are republishing this book now, in an affordable, high-quality, modern edition.

20634,10166834,"The Sleeping Bard; Or, Visions of the World, Death, and Hell",Ellis Wynne,"Reverend Ellis Wynne (1671-1734) was a Welsh clergyman and author of one of the most important and influential pieces of Welsh language literature. Born in Lasynys Fawr near Harlech, Wynne excelled at school and entered Jesus College, Oxford in 1692. He was ordained a priest in 1704. Although a respected priest, Welsh translator and hymn writer, Wynne is remembered today largely because of his literary output. His Gweledigaetheu y Bardd Cwsc (The Visions of the Sleeping Bard), first published in London in 1703 was immediately regarded as a Welsh language classic. It is generally said that no better model exists of such 'pure' idiomatic Welsh, before writers had become influenced by English style and method. It is interesting to note that on the title page of the book, the words Y Rhann Gyntaf - 'The First Part' appear; it has been suggested that Wynne had indeed written a second part - a 'Vision of heaven', but on hearing that he had been charged with plagiarism of the first part, destroyed the manuscript. The charges of plagiarism were never substantiated and are, today, regarded as false.",3.00,5:0|4:0|3:1|2:0|1:0|total:1,0,0,104,Dodo Press,eng,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1409928578,9781409928577,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10166834-the-sleeping-bard-or-visions-of-the-world-death-and-hell

Inoltre, in quei tempi in cui l'aristocrazia sosteneva ancora fieramente tutti i pregiudizi di casta, non poteva entrare nemmeno un momento in capo al conte che sua figlia potesse volgere un solo sguardo verso una persona cotanto oscura qual era il povero artista. Assisteva anche spesso alla lezione. Ida dunque aveva aperto il cembalo e lasciava che le sue belle dita errassero alla ventura sui tasti, -quando a un tratto il conte entro-cosa insolita a quell'ora. Era vestito con molta cura ed il suo viso sembrava irradiato da una espressione di contento. Si avvicino a sua figlia, le prese le due mani nelle sue e baciandola in fronte le disse: -Ti raccomando, mia cara, che oggi ti abbi a far bella, piu bella che sia possibile. E un sorriso che voleva dir molte cose passava intanto sulle sue labbra. -Perche, mio padre? domando Ida, fissandolo coi suoi grandi occhi azzurri. -Perche? Lo vedrai fra non molto. -Attendete forse qualcuno? Un nuovo sorriso, piu prolungato del primo, venne ad illuminare il volto del conte. E in poche parole racconto a sua figlia, la quale molto si stupi di un avvenimento tanto straordinario, come davvero attendesse qualcuno, il marchese di Sentis, un parente lontano. -La lettera che mi hai veduto leggere era sua. Egli deve arrivare oggi. E un bravo, simpatico e bel giovane, buon gentiluomo e padrone di grasse terre in Normandia che quei briganti del 93 non gli hanno potuto carpire.

20641,2180191,"Through Three Campaigns: A Story of Chitral, Tirah and Ashanti",G.A. Henty,"George Alfred Henty (8 December 1832 - 16 November 1902) was a prolific English novelist and war correspondent.He is best known for his historical adventure stories that were popular in the late 19th century. His works include The Dragon &amp; The Raven (1886), For The Temple (1888), Under Drake's Flag (1883) and In Freedom's Cause (1885).Biography--G.A.Henty was born in Trumpington, near Cambridge. He was a sickly child who had to spend long periods in bed. During his frequent illnesses he became an avid reader and developed a wide range of interests which he carried into adulthood. He attended Westminster School, London, and later Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he was a keen sportsman. He left the university early without completing his degree to volunteer for the Army Hospital Commissariat when the Crimean War began. He was sent to the Crimea and while there he witnessed the appalling conditions under which the British soldier had to fight. His letters home were filled with vivid descriptions of what he saw. His father was impressed by his letters and sent them to The Morning Advertiser newspaper which printed them. This initial writing success was a factor in Henty's later decision to accept the offer to become a special correspondent, the early name for journalists now better known as war correspondents. Shortly before resigning from the army as a captain in 1859 he married Elizabeth Finucane. The couple had four children. Elizabeth died in 1865 after a long illness and shortly after her death Henty began writing articles for the Standard newspaper. In 1866 the newspaper sent him as their special correspondent to report on the Austro-Italian War where he met Giuseppe Garibaldi. He went on to cover the 1868 British punitive expedition to Abyssinia, the Franco-Prussian War, the Ashanti War, the Carlist Rebellion in Spain and the Turco-Serbian War.He also witnessed the opening of the Suez Canal and travelled to Palestine, Russia and India. Henty was a strong supporter of the British Empire all his life; according to literary critic Kathryn Castle: ""Henty...exemplified the ethos of the new imperialism, and glorified in its successes.""Henty's ideas about politics were influenced by writers such as Sir Charles Dilke and Thomas Carlyle.Henty once related in an interview how his storytelling skills grew out of tales told after dinner to his children. He wrote his first children's book, Out on the Pampas in 1868, naming the book's main characters after his children. The book was published by Griffith and Farran in November 1870 with a title page date of 1871. While most of the 122 books he wrote were for children, he also wrote adult novels, non-fiction such as The March to Magdala and Those Other Animals, short stories for the likes of The Boy's Own Paper and edited the Union Jack, a weekly boy's magazine. Walter Stanley Paget (1863-1935), the youngest and perhaps the least artistically talented of the three Paget brothers, held a gold medal from the Royal Academy of Art, and, like his brothers, illustrated books and magazines in late nineteenth-century and early twentieth-century London, signing himself as ""Wal Paget""",3.82,5:9|4:9|3:7|2:2|1:1|total:28,19,0,,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1435300033,9781435300033,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2180191.Through_Three_Campaigns

20651,6112614,A Jolly Fellowship,Frank R.

From the hilarious satire of sensationalism in 'The Siamese Twin of a Bomb-Thrower' to the bizarre and operatic melodrama of 'The Ghost with the Club-Foot', Barr's stories delight the reader with their skill, variety, and never-abandoned sense of spirited fun.

In this brilliant novel of dazzling ingenuity, Anax’s examination leads us into a future where we are confronted with unresolved questions raised by science and philosophy. Centuries old, these questions have gained new urgency in the face of rapidly developing technology. What is consciousness? What makes us human?

A julep there is on the table beside me, flavoured with mint gathered by the hands of John Cotton early in the morning, while the dew was still upon it, from the finest bank in all Kent County.<br /><br />So with these old friends around me, with the julep on my right hand and the paper before me, I sit on the great porch of Fairlee to write of the wild days of my youth, when I first drew my sword in the Great Cause. To write, before my hand becomes feeble and my eyes grow dim, of the strange things that I saw and the adventures that befell me, of the old Tory of the Braes, of the fair maid his daughter, and of the part they played in my life during the War of the Deliverance. To write so that those who come after me, as well as those who are growing up around my knees, may know the part their grandfather played in the stirring times that proclaimed the birth of a mighty nation.<br /><br />The first year of the great struggle, ah, me!

20685,13270,Poetics,Aristotle,"<i>‘The plot is the source and the soul of tragedy’</i><br /><br />In his near-contemporary account of Greek tragedy, Aristotle examines the dramatic elements of plot, character, language and spectacle that combine to produce pity and fear in the audience, and asks why we derive pleasure from this apparently painful process. Taking examples from the plays of Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides, The Poetics introduces into literary criticism such central concepts as <i>mimesis</i> (‘imitation’), <i>hamartia</i> (‘error’), and <i>katharsis</i> (‘purification’). Aristotle explains how the most effective tragedies rely on complication and resolution, recognition and reversals, centring on characters of heroic stature, idealized yet true to life. One of the most powerful, perceptive and influential works of criticism in Western literary history, the <i>Poetics</i> has informed serious thinking about drama ever since.<br /><br />Malcolm Heath’s lucid English translation makes the <i>Poetics</i> fully accessible to the modern reader. It is accompanied by an extended introduction, which discusses the key concepts in detail and includes suggestions for further reading.",3.82,5:4691|4:5685|3:4504|2:1161|1:272|total:16313,12215,463,61,Penguin Classics,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1520340549l/13270._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1520340549l/13270._SY75_.jpg,0140446362,9780140446364,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13270.Poetics

In the pages that follow my aim has been to gather a Sussex bouquet rather than to present the facts which the more practical traveller requires. <br /><br />The order of progress through the country has been determined largely by the lines of railway. I have thought it best to enter Sussex in the west at Midhurst, making that the first centre, and to zig-zag thence across to the east by way of Chichester, Arundel, Petworth, Horsham, Brighton (I name only the chief centres), Cuckfield East Grinstead, Lewes, Eastbourne, Hailsham, Hastings, Rye, and Tunbridge Wells; leaving the county finally at Withyham, on the borders of Ashdown Forest. For the traveller in a carriage or on a bicycle this route is not the best; but for those who would explore it slowly on foot (and much of the more characteristic scenery of Sussex can be studied only in this way), with occasional assistance from the train, it is, I think, as good a scheme as any.",3.54,5:3|4:3|3:5|2:2|1:0|total:13,3,1,,,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1382928822l/6179520._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1382928822l/6179520._SX50_.jpg,1436870291,9781436870290,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6179520-highways-and-byways-in-sussex

This happened in 1887. I was living at the time in Boston, and had not seen the West for several years, and my return to the scenes of my boyhood started me upon a series of stories delineative of farm and village life as I knew it and had lived it. I wrote busily during the two years that followed, and in this revised definitive edition of Main-Travelled Roads and its companion volume. Other Main-Travelled Roads (compiled from other volumes which now go out of print), the reader will find all of the short stories which came from my pen between 1887 and 1889. <br />It remains to say that, though conditions have changed somewhat since that time, yet for the hired man and the renter farm life in the West is still a stern round of drudgery.

Donc le Renard de la mer et ton grand-pere etaient comme freres. Un soir d'hiver, nous etions reunis ici dans cette meme chambre, bien chaudement pres d'un bon feu, fumant du tabac de Hollande et buvant de l'ale d'Angleterre. Un corsaire, ami de mon pere, nous racontait ses courses lointaines et ses combats; je l'ecoutais comme tu m'ecoutes; tout a coup la porte s'ouvre, et le Renard de mer apparait, enveloppe d'un long manteau goudronne, tout ruisselant d'eau; il pleuvait a torrents et la mer etait grosse. Sous son manteau, le Renard etait arme en guerre. Antoine, dit-il a mon pere, j'ai besoin de toi, de ton fils, de ton equipage et de ton brigantin. --Quand cela? dit mon pere. --A l'heure meme, repondit le Renard, et pour aller en haute mer. --Nous allons, mon fils et moi, nous armer pour te suivre, dit simplement mon pere. Ce fut bientot fait. Nous sortimes tous les trois et nous nous rendimes au port. La nuit etait sombre. Onze heures sonnaient au carillon. Nous trouvames notre brigantin, l'Arondelle-de-Mer, avec tout son equipage a bord. C'etait le vouloir de mon pere; il fallait que l'on fut pret au depart a toute heure. Le bosseman leva l'ancre. Quand nous fumes en pleine mer, le Renard fit apporter sur le pont des piques, des coutelas, des espontons, des haches d'armes, et dit a chacun de s'armer pour etre pret au point du jour pour n'importe quelle chance. Une fois arme, tout l'equipage se mit en priere.

20708,35768289,A Son of the City a Story of Boy Life,Fred J Arting,"CHAPTER I IN WHICH OUR HERO GOES FISHING Startled from a sound sleep, he fumbled blindly beneath the bed that he might throttle the insistent alarm clock before the clamor awakened the other members of the household. Then he lay back and listened breathlessly for parental voices of inquiry as to what he might be doing at the unearthly hour of half-past three on a late September morning. Far down the railroad embankment which passed the rear of the house, an engine puffed lazily cityward with a load of empty freight cars. Over the elevated tracks a mile to the south, a train rumbled somnolently towards the park terminal, and under the eaves of the house, just above his room, two sparrows squabbled sleepily. Inside, the only audible sounds were the chirpings of a cricket somewhere down the hall, and the furious, muffled pounding of his own little heart. He glanced from the window near the head of his bed. The air was oppressive with a strange, almost rural quietude. In the east, a faint streak of light brought the tree tops of the park into indistinct relief, and to the north a thin line of smoke floated apathetically from a hotel chimney to show that a light breeze from the west augured favorably for the morning's sport. Stockings, knickerbockers, and blouse were drawn on with unwonted rapidity. His coat and necktie he left hanging over the back of the chair, disdained as unnecessary impediments on a fishing trip. Then with a final glance from the window at the fast-graying sky, he reached behind the bookcase for his carefully concealed pole and tackle, gathered his shoes in one hand, and tiptoed down the pitchy hall with the stealth of a cat. Down the stairway he went, step at a time, scarcely daring to breathe as he shifted his weight again and again from one foot to the other. On the first landing, a board creaked with alarming distinctness. Came a maternal voice: ""John."" Her son hugged the stairway in a very agony of fear lest his carefully made plans had been spoiled. Why hadn't he walked along the end of the steps as bitter experience had taught? He knew that board was loose. Again the well-known tones: ""John, what are you doing?"" A subdued babel of conversation in the big south room followed, in which his father's deep bass took a prominent part. ""Nonsense, Jane, you're imagining things!"" ""But you know I forbade fishing during school mornings. And he was looking at the DuPree's weather vane when he watered the lawn last night. Get up and see what he's doing."" John drew a sigh of relief as the deep voice sounded a sleepy protest. Minutes passed. His legs became cramped from inaction, yet he dared not stir. Were his parents asleep? Or was Mrs. Fletcher waiting merely until some tell-tale noise enabled her to order John senior forth on an expedition which would result in certain detection? If he had only avoided that misstep!",0.00,5:0|4:0|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:0,0,0,,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1548044865,9781548044862,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35768289-a-son-of-the-city-a-story-of-boy-life

Then suddenly he reappeared, youthful, brilliant, ready to take over the Phoenix, the rebel group that worked to overthrow the tyranny that gripped the settlers on Mars.<br /><br />The Phoenix had been destroyed not once, not twice, but three times! But this time the resurrected Dark had new plans, plans which involved dangerous experiments in mutation and psionics.<br /><br />And now the rebels realized they were in double jeopardy. Not only from the government's desperate hatred of their movement, but also from the growing possibility that the new breed of mutated monsters would get out of hand and bring terrors never before known to man.<br /><br />*<br /><br />Charles L. Fontenay writes: ""I was born in Brazil of a father who was by birth English and by parentage German and French, and of a mother who was by birth American and by parentage American and Scottish. This mess of internationalism caused me some trouble in the army during World War II as the government couldn't decide whether I was American, British, or Brazilian; and both as an enlisted man and an officer I dealt in secret work which required citizenship by birth. On three occasions I had to dig into the lawbooks. Finally they gave up and admitted I was an American citizen....<br /><br />""I was raised on a West Tennessee farm and distinguished myself in school principally by being the youngest, smallest (and consequently the fastest-running) child in my classes ...

George made his way back again in time to see a half dozen of the savages dart off into the bush to the left.

The Professor could not see them clearly, so that he also took a position on the top of the wagon. ""Do you see any movement to the left of their camp?"" After gazing a while, Harry answered: ""It seems that another party is coming up."" In a moment more he continued: ""Yes, and they appear to be waiting in ambush for them.""

20759,40825484,"Punch, or the London Charivari, Volume 103, December 10, 1892",F C (Francis Cowley) Burnand,"Punch, or the London Charivari, Volume 103, December 10, 1892 F. C. (Francis Cowley) Burnand I may assume, that after the terrible example given in my last chapter, you have firmly made up your mind never on any account to take service in the great army of bores. But this determination is not all that is necessary. A man must constantly keep a strict guard on himself, lest he should unconsciously deviate even for a few minutes into the regions of boredom. Whatever you do, let nothing tempt you to relate more than once any grievance you may have. Nothing of course is more poisonous to the aggrieved one than to stifle his grievance absolutely. Once, and once only, he may produce it to his friends. I shall be blamed, perhaps, for making even this slight concession. Please be careful, therefore, not to abuse it. Is there in the whole world a more ridiculous sight than a strong, healthy, well-fed sportsman who wearies his companions one after another with the depressing recital of his ill-luck, or of the dastardly behaviour of the head-keeper in not stopping the whole party for half an hour to search for an imaginary bird, which is supposed to have fallen stone-dead somewhere or other; or of the iniquities of the man from whom he bought his cartridges in not loading them with the right charge; or any of the hundred inconveniences and injuries to which sportsmen are liable. All these things may be as he says they are. He may be the most unfortunate, the most unjustly treated of mankind. But why insist upon it? Why check the current of sympathy by the dam of constant repetition? And, after all, how trivial and absurd the whole thing is! Even a man whose career has been ruined by malicious persecution will be avoided like a pest if it is known that he dins the account of his wrongs into everyone's ears. How, then, shall the sufferer by the petty injuries of ordinary sport be listened to with patience? Of all bores, the grievancemonger is the fiercest and worst. Lay this great truth by in your memory, and be mindful of it in more important matters than sport when the occasion arises.

Although the fierce resistance by the First Corps during the bloody late afternoon of July 1 never received its due praise, Doubleday's account of Chancellorsville and Gettysburg stands as a passionate, uncompromising tribute.<br /><br />Excerpt from Chancellorsville and Gettysburg <br />In writing this narrative, which relates to the decisive campaign which freed the Northern States from invasion, it may not be out of place to state what facilities I have had for observation in the fulfilment of so important a task. I can only say that I was, to a considerable extent, an actor in the scenes I describe, and knew the principal leaders on both sides, in consequence of my association with them at West Point, and, subsequently, in the regular army. Indeed, several of them, including Stonewall Jackson and A. P. Hill, were, prior to the war, officers in the regiment to which I belonged. As commander of the Defences of Washington in the spring of 1862, I was, owing to the nature of my duties, brought into intimate relations with the statesmen who controlled the Government at that time, and became well acquainted with President Lincoln.",3.67,5:29|4:35|3:34|2:10|1:4|total:112,60,3,,,eng,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18889709-chancellorsville-and-gettysburg-campaigns-of-the-civil-war---vi

He was the eponym of the Caldecott Medal and transformed the world of children's books in the Victorian era. He exercised his art chiefly in book illustrations, which were full of life, and instinct with a kindly, graceful humour. The stories and rhymes were all of his choosing and in some cases were written or added to by himself. Caldecott's output, however, ranged wider than this: he illustrated novels and accounts of foreign travel; he made humourous drawings depicting hunting and fashionable life; he drew cartoons and he made sketches of the famous Parliament inside and out; he also exhibited sculptures and paintings in oil and watercolour in the Royal Academy and galleries.",3.60,5:0|4:4|3:0|2:1|1:0|total:5,4,1,344,Dodo Press,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1409930319,9781409930310,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6352629-r-caldecott-s-first-collection-of-pictures-and-songs

He was so bored with his own company that the Mentorian medic was a welcome sight when he came to prepare him for <i>cold-sleep</i>. <br /><br />The Mentorian paused, needle in hand. ""Do you wish to be wakened for the time we shall spend in each of the three star systems, sir? You can, of course, be given enough drug to keep you in cold-sleep until we reach your destination."" <br /><br />Bart felt tempted -- he wanted very much to see the other star systems. But he couldn't risk meeting other passengers. <br /><br />The needle went into his arm. In sudden panic, he realized he was helpless.

Stockton (1834-1902) was an American writer and humorist, best known today for a series of innovative children's fairy tales that were widely popular during the last decades of the 12th century. Stockton avoided the didactic moralizing common to children's stories of the time, instead using clever humor to poke at greed, violence, abuse of power and other human foibles, describing his fantastic characters' adventures in a charming, matterof- fact way in stories like The Griffin and the Minor Canon (1885) and The Bee-Man of Orn and Other Fanciful Tales (1887). His most famous fable is The Lady, or the Tiger? (1882), which is about a man sentenced to an unusual punishment for having a romance with a king's beloved daughter.",4.33,5:1|4:2|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:3,2,1,116,Dodo Press,eng,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1406579017,9781406579017,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8149718-ting-a-ling

20840,654691,Rebel Spurs,Andre Norton,"In 1866, only men uprooted by war had reason to ride into Tubacca, Arizona, a nondescript town as shattered and anonymous as the veterans drifting through it. So when Drew Rennie, newly discharged from Forrest's Confederate scouts, arrived leading everything he owned behind him-his thoroughbred stud Shiloh, a mare about to foal, and a mule-he knew his business would not be questioned. To anyone in Tubacca there could be only one extraordinary thing about Drew, and that he could not reveal: his name, Rennie. Drew had come west from Kentucky to find a father he had thought dead until the year before. Kinship with a man like Hunt Rennie, however-the legendary Don Cazar, owner of a matchless range and prize stallions-was not a claim to be made quickly or lightly. Posing as Drew Kirby the young veteran contrived to get himself and his friend Anse hired as corral hands at Rennie's Range, but he was hardly prepared for the suspicion and danger which stood between him and his father. As hotheaded as his father, Drew was ready to move on to California-until the day all proof of his Rennie name was stolen from him, and his unwarranted arrest for horse-thieving brought on the accusations of the one man whose trust he needed.<br /><br />Andre Norton's Ride Proud, Rebel! dramatically portrayed the last year of the Confederacy, when brave men like Drew Rennie met defeat with honor. In this sequel, Drew's struggle to establish his identity and begin life anew in a raw, unsettled land reflects the courage of thousands of rootless men set adrift by the American Civil War.",3.80,5:50|4:60|3:50|2:12|1:4|total:176,114,7,156,Wildside Press,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,143440045X,9781434400451,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/654691.Rebel_Spurs

It has worked well. It always arouses discussion, and in doing so it has the great virtue that it imperiously leads the argu ment away from superficialities and centers it upon fundamentals. Its service as a stimulus to high thinking cannot easily be overestimated. For any student, and especially for one who has known only the unidea'd criticism of fiction so popular today, it is a fine thing to come in con tact with a high-minded, sturdy, and uncomprom ising thinker such as Green is. As Green says of the hearer of tragedy, He bears about him, for a time at least, among the rank vapors of the earth, something of the freshness and fragrance of the higher air. I trust that this reprint, by making the essay more easily accessible than it has been heretofore, will help to raise the grade of student thought and taste and criticism.<br /><br />About the Publisher<br /><br />Forgotten Books publishes hundreds of thousands of rare and classic books.

20853,9112238,Northland Heroes,Florence Holbrook,"For centuries the songs of Homer, the blind poet of Greece, recounting the heroic deeds of the great Hector and lion-hearted Achilles, have delighted the children, young and old, of many lands. But part of our own heritage, and nearer to us in race and time, are these stories of Beowulf and Frithiof (Fridtjhof). The records of lives nobly lived are an inspiration to noble living. With the hope that the courage, truth, endurance, reverence, and patriotism shown by these heroes of the Northland will arouse interest and emulation. This little book is offered to our young adults and children. ""The Story of Frithiof"" is based upon Holcomb's translation of Bishop Tegner's poem, ""The Saga of Frithiof"" which charts Frithiof's and Ingeborg's undying love for each other and the lengths Frithiof had to go to, to eventually win her hand. If ever a story was to teach the young about perseverance and endurance, this is it. The epic Beowulf was written in England, but is set in Scandinavia. It has variously been dated to between the 8th and the early 11th centuries. The original is an epic poem told in historical perspective; a story of epic events and of great people of a heroic past. It follows the life of Beowulf, his rites of passage and his maturing from boy to man through facing and overcoming adversity and evil. This was the time when men were knighted for achieving great feats, and great their feats were. A time when the successful application of brain and brawn gained a man high standing in the community and possibly even higher office in the land. 33% of the net profit from this book will be donated to charity.",4.00,5:1|4:1|3:1|2:0|1:0|total:3,2,0,138,Abela Publishing,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1907256679,9781907256677,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9112238-northland-heroes

20863,11023816,Major Vigoureux,Arthur Quiller-Couch,"For a dozen years Major Narcisse Vigoureux had been, for an unmarried man, an exceedingly happy one. If you ask me how an officer bearing such a name happened in command of a British garrison, I answer that he was not a Frenchman, but a Channel Islander of good Jersey descent; and this again helped him to understand the folk over whom he ruled. The wrong-doers feared him; but they were few. By the rest of the population, including his soldiers, he was beloved, respected, not a little envied. For a bachelor he mingled with zest in the small social amusements of Garland Town, the capital of the Islands. He shone at picnics and water-parties. He played a fair hand at whist. His manner towards ladies was deferential; towards men, dignified without a trace of patronage or self-conceit. All voted him a good fellow. At first, indeed -- for he practised small economies, and his linen, though clean, was frayed -- they suspected him of stinginess, until by accident the Vicar discovered that a great part of his pay went to support his dead brother's family -- a widow and two girls who lived at Notting Hill, London, in far from affluent circumstances. In spite of this the Commandant's lot might fairly have been called enviable until the day which terminated the ninety-nine years' lease upon which the Duke held the Islands. Everyone took it for granted that he would apply, as his predecessors had twice applied, for a renewal. But, no; like a bolt from the blue came news that the Duke, an old man, had waived his application in favour of an unknown purchaser -- unknown, that is to say, in the Islands -- a London banker, recently created a baronet, by name Sir Caesar Hutchins.""",3.00,5:0|4:0|3:1|2:0|1:0|total:1,0,0,220,Wildside Press,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1434400409,9781434400406,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11023816-major-vigoureux

20870,3608020,The Motor Girls Through New England: Or Held by the Gypsies,Margaret Penrose,"CHAPTER I THE SHADOW ""Look, girls! There's a man!"" ""Where?"" ""Just creeping under the dining-room window!"" ""What can he want-looks suspicious!"" ""Oh, I'm afraid to go in!"" ""Hush! We won't go in just now!"" ""If only the boys were here!"" ""Well, don't cry-they will be here soon."" ""See! He's getting under the fence! There he goes!"" ""Did you get a look at him?"" ""Yes, a good look. I'll know him next time."" Bess, Belle and Cora were holding this whispered conversation. It was Belle, the timid, who wanted to cry, and it was Cora who had really seen the man-got the good look. Bess did say she wished the boys were around, but Bess had great confidence in those boys, and this remark, when a man was actually sneaking around Clover Cottage, was perfectly pardonable. The motor girls had just returned from a delightful afternoon ride along the shore road at Lookout Beach. Bess and Belle Robinson, otherwise Elizabeth and Isabel, the twins, were in their little car-the Flyaway-and Cora Kimball was driving her fine, four-cylinder touring affair, both machines having just pulled up in front of Clover Cottage, the summer home of the Robinsons. ""Did the boys say they would come directly from the post-office?"" askedBelle, as she eyed the back fence suspiciously. ""Yes, they had to drop some mail in the box. We won't attempt to go in until they come. At any rate, I have a little something to do to the Whirlwind,"" and Cora pulled off her gloves, and started to get a wrench out of the tool box. ""I'll get busy, too,"" declared Bess. ""It will look better in case our friend happens to come around the corner."" ""No danger,"" and Cora glanced up from the tool box. ""I fancy that gentleman is not of the type that runs into facts."" ""Do you think he is a burglar?"" asked Belle. ""Well, I wouldn't say just that. But he certainly is not straightforward. And that is a bad sign,"" replied Cora. ""And not a person in the house to help us,"" sighed Belle. ""Oh, I don't see why mamma--"" ""Now, Belle Robinson!"" interrupted her sister. ""You know perfectly well that mamma had to take Nellie and Rose over to Drifton. They have to get ready for school."" ""Mamma fusses a lot over those two girls,"" continued Belle. ""It seems to me a lucky thing they happened to run away-our way."" This remark was lost upon Bess and Cora. Bess was intent upon something-nothing definite-about the Flyaway, while Cora was working assiduously trying to adjust a leaky valve. The prospect of dark coming on with no one but themselves about the cottage, and the late appearance of the strange man, kept each one busy thinking. Presently Belle exclaimed: ""Oh, here come the boys!"" and without waiting for the young men to turn the corner, which marked the end of the Clover Cottage grounds, she ran along with the news. Jack Kimball, Cora's brother, Walter Pennington, his chum, and EdFoster, the friend of both, sauntered along.

20880,31578250,October: The Story of the Russian Revolution,China Miéville,"In February 1917, in the midst of bloody war, Russia was still an autocratic monarchy: nine months later, it became the first socialist state in world history. How did this unimaginable transformation take place? How was a ravaged and backward country, swept up in a desperately unpopular war, rocked by not one but two revolutions?<br /><br />This is the story of the extraordinary months between those upheavals, in February and October, of the forces and individuals who made 1917 so epochal a year, of their intrigues, negotiations, conflicts and catastrophes. From familiar names like Lenin and Trotsky to their opponents Kornilov and Kerensky; from the byzantine squabbles of urban activists to the remotest villages of a sprawling empire; from the revolutionary railroad Sublime to the ciphers and static of coup by telegram; from grand sweep to forgotten detail.<br /><br />Historians have debated the revolution for a hundred years, its portents and possibilities: the mass of literature can be daunting. But here is a book for those new to the events, told not only in their historical import but in all their passion and drama and strangeness. Because as well as a political event of profound and ongoing consequence, Miéville reveals the Russian Revolution as a breathtaking story.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",3.92,5:897|4:1486|3:784|2:148|1:31|total:3346,2742,407,369,Verso,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1471889774l/31578250._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1471889774l/31578250._SX50_.jpg,1784782777,9781784782771,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31578250-october

This thinly fictionalized account of Claude Brown's childhood as a hardened, streetwise criminal trying to survive the toughest streets of Harlem has been heralded as the definitive account of everyday life for the first generation of African Americans raised in the Northern ghettos of the 1940s and 1950s. <br /><br />When the book was first published in 1965, it was praised for its realistic portrayal of Harlem -- the children, young people, hardworking parents; the hustlers, drug dealers, prostitutes, and numbers runners; the police; the violence, sex, and humor. <br /><br />The book continues to resonate generations later, not only because of its fierce and dignified anger, not only because the struggles of urban youth are as deeply felt today as they were in Brown's time, but also because the book is affirmative and inspiring. Here is the story about the one who ""made it,"" the boy who kept landing on his feet and became a man.",4.35,5:3977|4:2229|3:894|2:160|1:69|total:7329,6975,263,,,eng,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,0684864185,9780684864181,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/289114.Manchild_in_the_Promised_Land

20909,10338691,Cocktail Hour Under the Tree of Forgetfulness,Alexandra Fuller,"In this sequel to <i>Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight</i>, Alexandra Fuller returns to Africa and the story of her unforgettable family. <br /><br />In <i>Cocktail Hour Under the Tree of Forgetfulness</i>, Alexandra Fuller braids a multilayered narrative around the perfectly lit, Happy Valley-era Africa of her mother's childhood; the boiled cabbage grimness of her father's English childhood; and the darker, civil war-torn Africa of her own childhood. At its heart, this is the story of Fuller's mother, Nicola. Born on the Scottish Isle of Skye and raised in Kenya, Nicola holds dear the kinds of values most likely to get you hurt or killed in Africa: loyalty to blood, passion for land, and a holy belief in the restorative power of all animals. Fuller interviewed her mother at length and has captured her inimitable voice with remarkable precision. <i>Cocktail Hour Under the Tree of Forgetfulness</i> is as funny, terrifying, exotic, and unselfconscious as Nicola herself. <br /><br />We see Nicola and Tim Fuller in their lavender-colored honeymoon period, when East Africa lies before them with all the promise of its liquid equatorial light, even as the British Empire in which they both believe wanes. But in short order, an accumulation of mishaps and tragedies bump up against history until the couple finds themselves in a world they hardly recognize. We follow the Fullers as they hopscotch the continent, running from war and unspeakable heartbreak, from Kenya to Rhodesia to Zambia, even returning to England briefly. But just when it seems that Nicola has been broken entirely by Africa, it is the African earth itself that revives her. <br /><br />A story of survival and madness, love and war, loyalty and forgiveness, <i>Cocktail Hour Under the Tree of Forgetfulness</i> is an intimate exploration of the author's family. In the end, we find Nicola and Tim at a coffee table under their Tree of Forgetfulness on the banana and fish farm where they plan to spend their final days. In local custom, the Tree of Forgetfulness is where villagers meet to resolve disputes and it is here that the Fullers at last find an African kind of peace. Following the ghosts and dreams of memory, <i>Cocktail Hour Under the Tree of Forgetfulness</i> is Alexandra Fuller at her very best.",3.87,5:2846|4:4628|3:2499|2:589|1:188|total:10750,9394,1276,256,Penguin Press,eng,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1594202990,9781594202995,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10338691-cocktail-hour-under-the-tree-of-forgetfulness

20924,806311,Don Quijote de la Mancha (Catedra Base / Cathedral Base),Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra,"Don Quixote has become so entranced by reading chivalric romances, that he determines to become a knight-errant himself. In the company of his faithful squire, Sancho Panza, his exploits blossom in all sorts of wonderful ways. While Quixote's fancy often leads him astray – he tilts at windmills, imagining them to be giants – Sancho acquires cunning and a certain sagacity. Sane madman and wise fool, they roam the world together, and together they have haunted readers' imaginations for nearly four hundred years.<br /><br />With its experimental form and literary playfulness, <i>Don Quixote</i> generally has been recognized as the first modern novel. The book has had enormous influence on a host of writers, from Fielding and Sterne to Flaubert, Dickens, Melville, and Faulkner, who reread it once a year, ""just as some people read the Bible.""",3.87,5:64137|4:59812|3:44307|2:14226|1:5390|total:187872,6,0,,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,8437622093,9788437622095,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/806311.Don_Quijote_de_la_Mancha

Fremantle of the British Coldstream Guards toured the Confederacy. Mildly predisposed toward the Union side because of his dislike of slavery, he was soon awakened to the gallantry of Jefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee and his generals, ordinary Johnny Rebs, and the women left at home.

Le texte est ecrit en moyen anglais, en vers pour la majeure partie. Les contes sont integres dans une histoire - cadre - et dits par un groupe de pelerins faisant route de Southwark a Cantorbery pour visiter le sanctuaire de Thomas Becket dans la cathedrale de Cantorbery. En tout 24 contes sont effectivement prononces par les pelerins, ce qui semble loin du total prevu initialement. Les Contes de Canterbury (de Chaucer) et Sire Gauvain et le Chevalier vert (d'un anonyme) sont, avec Pierre le laboureur (de William Langland), les toutes premieres grandes uvres de la litterature anglaise.

Abandoned at a young age of 3, he spared no time in growing up in Charles Clementine, a humble orphanage run by Dr. Rose Morris. His self-reliance earned him a comfortable adult life, however, it had also hardened his core, keeping everyone at arm’s length. His life finally started to turn for the better when he ran into Jerry, an old classmate who worked part time as a security guard at the local library.<br /><br />Richard came to the world knowing he was unwanted. Having been given up at birth, the only people he could rely on were his best friend Tom, Dr. Morris, and her husband Cody Lewis, who stood by Richard relentlessly like a father. Richard’s lifelong attempt to deny his feelings for Tom was further complicated when Jerry came into Tom’s life. Jerry was able to fulfill Tom’s needs as a lover and a friend, and it threatened what little connection Richard had with the man he spent his whole life trying to fall out of love with.<br /><br />Harry Lincoln was born fully-grown, for he has no memory of the days before he woke up in a small hospital in West Virginia. But against all odds, he managed to find his way in life, and ended up a nurse working for Dr. Morris. The crush he developed for Richard was almost instantaneous, and as the natural magnetism of Richard’s tender personality caused his hormones to surge out of control, it threatened to expose something sinister from Harry’s forgotten past.<br /><br />Tom, Dick &amp; Harry chronicles how the most unexpected of circumstances brought three strangers in Kelson City together, and although the stark differences of their personalities seem like a perfect recipe for chaos, what little they do have in common are the very things that keep their lives forever intertwined.",3.57,5:2|4:2|3:2|2:0|1:1|total:7,6,1,453,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1362165909l/17452530._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1362165909l/17452530._SY75_.jpg,1480181080,9781480181083,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17452530-tom-dick-and-harry

Colin Dare, who was sitting beside the broken whale-gun and who had been promised that he might go in the boat that would be put out from the ship if a whale were sighted, jumped to his feet at the cry from the 'barrel' at the masthead. ""Where?"" he shouted eagerly, rushing to the rail and staring as hard as he could at the heaving gray waters of the Behring Sea. ""There she blo-o-ows!"" again cried the lookout, in the long echoing call of the old-time whaler, and stretching out his hand, he pointed to a spot in the ocean about three points off the starboard bow. Colin's glance followed the direction, and almost immediately he saw the faint cloud of vapor which showed that a whale had just spouted.

They ran rapidly through numerous editions, were set to music, and sung in every drawing-room, and in the United States obtained even greater public acclaim. In 1867 she published The Story of Doom and other Poems, and then gave up verse for a while and became industrious as a novelist. Off the Skelligs appeared in 1872, Fated to Be Free in 1873, Sarah de Berenger in 1880, and John Jerome in 1886.

21016,1180695,Essays on the Theory of Numbers,Richard Dedekind,"This volume contains the two most important essays on the logical foundations of the number system by the famous German mathematician J. W. R. Dedekind. The first presents Dedekind's theory of the irrational number-the Dedekind cut idea-perhaps the most famous of several such theories created in the 19th century to give a precise meaning to irrational numbers, which had been used on an intuitive basis since Greek times. This paper provided a purely arithmetic and perfectly rigorous foundation for the irrational numbers and thereby a rigorous meaning of continuity in analysis.<br />The second essay is an attempt to give a logical basis for transfinite numbers and properties of the natural numbers. It examines the notion of natural numbers, the distinction between finite and transfinite (infinite) whole numbers, and the logical validity of the type of proof called mathematical or complete induction.<br />The contents of these essays belong to the foundations of mathematics and will be welcomed by those who are prepared to look into the somewhat subtle meanings of the elements of our number system. As a major work of an important mathematician, the book deserves a place in the personal library of every practicing mathematician and every teacher and historian of mathematics.

But she soon finds herself riding in the back of an ambulance, watching helplessly as Sarah fights for her life. As they race to the hospital, Sarah talks to someone who is not there...and hums a melody Ann has never heard before.<br /><br />That unfamiliar, unearthly beautiful melody keeps finding Ann--first in the hospital chapel, then in her dreams, and finally in Sarah's empty house.<br /><br />Two neighbors have a profound effect on Ann. Ethan McKinney lends her a shoulder to lean on. And as a carpenter, he volunteers to help Ann get the Fletcher family home into shape for selling. His strong presence is a pleasing distraction. Ann's twelve-year-old neighbor, Keith, has Down Syndrome and the guile to believe he can actually see and hear angels. In fact, he insists they are looking out for her in ways she's never imagined.<br /><br />God begins to reveal himself to Ann--both in her newfound friends and through supernatural events.

Eventually Nora Gallagher entered into a yearlong journey to discover her faith and a relationship with God, using the Christian calendar as her compass.<br /><br />Whether writing about her brother's battle against cancer, talking to homeless men about the World Series, or questioning the afterlife (""One world at a time""), Gallagher draws us into a world of journeys and mysteries, yet grounded in a gritty reality. She braids together the symbols of the Christian calendar, the events of a year in one church, and her own spiritual journey, each strand combed out with harrowing intimacy. Thought provoking and profoundly perceptive, <b>Things Seen and Unseen</b> is a remarkable demonstration that ""the road to the sacred is paved with the ordinary.""<br /><br />""Like Kathleen Norris in <b>Amazing Grace</b>, Gallagher is renewing the language of ultimate concerns.""--<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i><br /><br />""The deep serenity that suffuses Gallagher's work, the lyrical cadences in which she writes, do not blunt the sharp edges of what she discovered in her quest for meaning.""--<i>Los Angeles Times</i>",4.15,5:119|4:134|3:49|2:9|1:2|total:313,289,28,256,Vintage,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320505058l/331947._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320505058l/331947._SY75_.jpg,0679775498,9780679775492,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/331947.Things_Seen_and_Unseen

21044,5686003,The Willoughby Captains,Talbot Baines Reed,"Talbot Baines Reed (1852-1893) was an English writer who specialised in boys' school stories, the most famous of which were The Fifth Form at St. Dominic's (1881) and The Adventures of a Three-Guinea Watch (1883). Born in Hackney, London, Reed was the third son of Sir Charles Reed, who served as Member of Parliament for the borough. Reed's family was also closely involved with the Religious Tract Society, which founded the Boy's Own Paper, a periodical which published all of his stories. Reed more than any other late 19th century writer was responsible for the ensuing popularity of school stories in British children's fiction. Although all of Reed's school stories were first serialised in the Boy's Own Paper, some of them were published in book form, both during and after the author's life. Works include: My Friend Smith (1882), The Willoughby Captains (1883), Reginald Cruden (1885), Follow My Leader (1885), A Dog With a Bad Name (1886), The Master of the Shell (1887), Sir Ludar (1889), Roger Ingleton, Minor (1889), Tom, Dick and Harry (1892), Kilgorman (1894), Parkhurst Boys (1905) and Boycotted (1917).",4.31,5:11|4:0|3:4|2:1|1:0|total:16,11,2,,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1434667480,9781434667489,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5686003-the-willoughby-captains

It is from Captain Vernon."" My heart leapt with sudden excitement, and my hand trembled as I stretched it out for the proffered epistle. The mention of Captain Vernon's name, together with the announcement that the subject-matter of the letter was of interest to me, prepared me in a great measure for the intelligence it conveyed; which was to the effect that the writer, having been appointed to the command of the sloop-of-war Daphne, now found himself in a position to fulfil a promise of some standing to his dear and honoured friend Dr Hawkesley (my father) by receiving his son (myself) on board the sloop, with the rating of midshipman. The sloop, the letter went on to say, was commissioned for service on the west coast of Africa; and if I decided to join her no time should be lost in procuring my outfit, as the Daphne was under orders to sail on the-; just four days from the date of the receipt of the letter.",3.67,5:0|4:5|3:0|2:1|1:0|total:6,3,0,244,IndyPublish.com,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1435319966,9781435319967,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2128064.The_Congo_Rovers

21076,21324631,The First Six Books of the Elements of Euclid,John  Casey,"This edition of the Elements of Euclid, undertaken at the request of the prin-<br />cipals of some of the leading Colleges and Schools of Ireland, is intended to<br />supply a want much felt by teachers at the present day—the production of a<br />work which, while giving the unrivalled original in all its integrity, would also<br />contain the modern conceptions and developments of the portion of Geometry<br />over which the Elements extend. A cursory examination of the work will show<br />that the Editor has gone much further in this latter direction than any of his<br />predecessors, for it will be found to contain, not only more actual matter than<br />is given in any of theirs with which he is acquainted, but also much of a special<br />character, which is not given, so far as he is aware, in any former work on the<br />subject. The great extension of geometrical methods in recent times has made<br />such a work a necessity for the student, to enable him not only to read with ad-<br />vantage, but even to understand those mathematical writings of modern times<br />which require an accurate knowledge of Elementary Geometry, and to which it<br />is in reality the best introduction.<br />In compiling his work the Editor has received invaluable assistance from the<br />late Rev. Professor Townsend, s.f.t.c.d. The book was rewritten and con-<br />siderably altered in accordance with his suggestions, and to that distinguished<br />Geometer it is largely indebted for whatever merit it possesses.<br />The Questions for Examination in the early part of the First Book are in-<br />tended as specimens, which the teacher ought to follow through the entire work.<br />Every person who has had experience in tuition knows well the importance of<br />such examinations in teaching Elementary Geometry.<br />The Exercises, of which there are over eight hundred, have been all selected<br />with great care. Those in the body of each Book are intended as applications of<br />Euclid’s Propositions. They are for the most part of an elementary character,<br />and may be regarded as common property, nearly every one of them having<br />appeared already in previous collections. The Exercises at the end of each<br />Book are more advanced; several are due to the late Professor Townsend, some<br />are original, and a large number have been taken from two important French<br />works—Catalan’s Th´eor`emes et Probl`emes de G´eom´etrie El´ementaire, and<br />the Trait´e de G´eom´etrie, by Rouch´ e and De Comberousse.<br />The second edition has been thoroughly revised and greatly enlarged. The<br />new matter includes several alternative proofs, important examination questions<br />on each of the books, an explanation of the ratio of incommensurable quantities,<br />the ﬁrst twenty-one propositions of Book XI., and an Appendix on the properties<br />of the Prism, Pyramids, Cylinder, Sphere, and Cone.<br />The present Edition has been very carefully read throughout, and it is hoped<br />that few misprints have escaped detection.<br />The Editor is glad to ﬁnd from the rapid sale of former editions (each 3000<br />copies) of his Book, and its general adoption in schools, that it is likely to accomplish the double object with which it was written, viz. to supply students<br />with a Manual that will impart a thorough knowledge of the immortal work<br />of the great Greek Geometer, and introduce them, at the same time, to some<br />of the most important conceptions and developments of the Geometry of the<br />present day.",3.00,5:0|4:0|3:1|2:0|1:0|total:1,1,0,,,eng,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21324631-the-first-six-books-of-the-elements-of-euclid
21077,40704427,The Mind and the Brain: Being the Authorised Translation of l'Ame Et Le Corps,Alfred Bine Binet,"The Mind and the Brain Being the Authorised Translation of L'Ame et le Corps Alfred Binet This book is a prolonged effort to establish a distinction between what is called mind and what is called matter. Nothing is more simple than to realise this distinction when you do not go deeply into it; nothing is more difficult when you analyse it a little. At first sight, it seems impossible to confuse things so far apart as a thought and a block of stone; but on reflection this great contrast vanishes, and other differences have to be sought which are less apparent and of which one has not hitherto dreamed. We are delighted to publish this classic book as part of our extensive Classic Library collection. Many of the books in our collection have been out of print for decades, and therefore have not been accessible to the general public. The aim of our publishing program is to facilitate rapid access to this vast reservoir of literature, and our view is that this is a significant literary work, which deserves to be brought back into print after many decades. The contents of the vast majority of titles in the Classic Library have been scanned from the original works. To ensure a high quality product, each title has been meticulously hand curated by our staff. Our philosophy has been guided by a desire to provide the reader with a book that is as close as possible to ownership of the original work. We hope that you will enjoy this wonderful classic work, and that for you it becomes an enriching experience.",0.00,5:0|4:0|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:0,0,0,84,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1722002425,9781722002428,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40704427-the-mind-and-the-brain

21080,47447244,"The Astral Plane: Its Scenery, Inhabitants And Phenomena",C W Leadbeater,"Few words are needed in sending this little book out into the world. It is the fifth of a series of Manuals designed to meet the public demand for a simple exposition of Theosophical teachings. Some have complained that our literature is at once too abstruse, too technical, and too expensive for the ordinary reader, and it is our hope that the present series may succeed in supplying what is a very real want. Theosophy is not only for the learned; it is for all. Perhaps among those who in these little books catch their first glimpse of its teachings, there may be a few who will be led by them to penetrate more deeply into its philosophy, its science and its religion, facing its abstruser problems with the student's zeal and the neophyte's ardour. But these Manuals are not written for the eager student, whom no initial difficulties can daunt; they are written for the busy men and women of the work-a-day world, and seek to make plain some of the great truths that render life easier to bear and death easier to face. Written by servants of the Masters who are the Elder Brothers of our race, they can have no other object than to serve our fellow-men. <br /> Reference to the astral plane, or K�maloka as it is called in Sanskrit, has frequently been made by Theosophical writers, and a good deal of information on the subject of this realm of nature is to be found scattered here and there in our books; but there is not, so far as I am aware, any single volume to which one can turn for a complete summary of the facts at present known to us about this interesting region. The object of this manual is to collect and make some attempt to arrange this scattered information, and also to supplement it slightly in cases where new facts have come to our knowledge. - Taken from ""The Astral Plane: Its Scenery, Inhabitants, and Phenomena"" written by C.

21093,20527791,"The Journal of Negro History, Volume 4, 1919",Carter G. Woodson,"The Journal of Negro History was founded on January 1, 1916 as a quarterly research journal. It was published by the Association for the Study of African American Life and History founded in 1915 by Carter G. Woodson and Jesse E. Moorland. In 2002, The Journal of Negro History became The Journal of African American History. Carter Godwin Woodson (1875-1950) was born in New Canton, Virginia. He was an African American historian, author, journalist and the founder of Black History Month. He is considered the first to conduct a scholarly effort to popularize the value of Black History. Woodson recognized and acted upon the importance of a people having an awareness and knowledge of their contributions to humanity and left behind an impressive legacy. He was a member of the first black fraternity Sigma Pi Phi and a member of Omega Psi Phi as well. In 1915, Woodson and Jesse E. Moorland co-founded the Association for the Study of African American Life and History. By this time convinced that the role of his own people in American history and in the history of other cultures was being either ignored or misrepresented among scholars, Woodson realized the need for special research into the neglected past of the Negro. In the same year appeared one of his most scholarly books, The Education of the Negro Prior to 1861 (1915). He also was the author of A Century of Negro Migration (1918).",0.00,5:0|4:0|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:0,0,0,,,eng,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20527791-the-journal-of-negro-history-volume-4-1919

21097,35809132,Tom Finch's Monkey and How He Dined with the Admiral,John C (John Conroy) Hutcheson,"And how he Dined with the Admiral. We were cruising off Callao on the Pacific station when it all happened, and I daresay there are a good many others who will recollect all about it as well as myself. But to explain the matter properly I must go back a little in my dates; for, instead of Callao at the commencement of my yarn, you must read Calabar. You see, I was in the Porpoise at the time, a small old-fashioned, paddle-wheel steamer that had been ordered across from the West Coast of Africa by ""my lords"" of the Admiralty to reinforce our squadron in South American waters on account of a war breaking out between Chili and Peru. Being a ""sub"" on board of her, and consequently subject to the authorities that be, when the Porpoise was obliged to abandon the fragrant mangrove swamps at the mouth of the Congo river, where we had been enjoying ourselves for over a twelvemonth amidst the delights of a deadly miasma that brought on perpetual low fever, and as constant a consumption of quinine and bottled beer to counteract its effects, I was of course forced to accompany her across the Atlantic and round the Horn to her allotted destination. Thence ""this plain unvarnished tale,"" which is as clear as mud in a ditch, although you needn't believe it if you don't like-there is no compulsion required to make hungry people eat roast mutton! Tom Finch, the lieutenant in command of the Porpoise, who had got his promotion through the death vacancy of his senior at Cape Coast Castle-he was just ahead of me on the roster, luckily for him-was one of the jolliest fellows I ever sailed with or under, since I entered the service; and I'm sure I've known a few ""swabs"" in my time! Unlike some junior officers I could name, when suddenly intrusted with the reins of power, there was nothing of the martinet about Tom, even on the first day he assumed his new rank, when a little extra pomposity might have been excusable. But no, he gave himself no airs or graces whatever. He was the same Tom Finch who had chaffed and larked and talked confidence with me in the gunroom, now that he trod the quarter-deck ""in all his war paint,"" as I told him somewhat impudently, the ""skipper"" of HMS Porpoise, ""paddle sloop, 6 guns,"" as she was described in the Navy List-the same unaffected, jovial, good-natured sailor whom everybody liked, men and messmates alike. His only weakness was a love for practical joking, which he would carry out sometimes, perhaps, to a rather ticklish extent-for his own good, that is, as he never knowingly did anyone else an injury by it. ""What will you do with your monkey?"" I said, when the mail brought in our orders from the commodore on the West Coast for us to sail for Monte Video at once, and there await our further instructions-which would be sent on from England; ""what will you do with him when we go?"" ""Take him with me of course,"" answered Tom; ""why shouldn't I?"" ""Well, I don't see any reason against it certainly,"" I replied; ""now that you are captain of the ship, and can do as you please without asking anybody's leave."" ""Poor Griffin,"" said Tom, ""he did object to Jocko's society; that was the reason I always used to keep the dear fellow ashore; however, as you say, Gerald, I am my own master and can do as I like now....",0.00,5:0|4:0|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:0,0,0,,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1548088714,9781548088712,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35809132-tom-finch-s-monkey-and-how-he-dined-with-the-admiral

He has left each of them a clue to her true heritage, and Star nervously decides to follow hers, which leads her to an antiquarian bookshop in London, and the start of a whole new world.<br /> <br /> A hundred years earlier, headstrong and independent Flora MacNichol vows she will never marry. She is happy and secure in her home in England’s picturesque Lake District—just a stone’s throw away from the residence of her childhood idol, Beatrix Potter—when machinations lead her to London, and the home of one of Edwardian society’s most notorious society hostesses, Alice Keppel. Flora is torn between passionate love and her duty to her family, but finds herself a pawn in a larger game. That is, until a meeting with a mysterious gentleman unveils the answers that Flora has been searching for her whole life...<br /> <br /> As Star learns more of Flora’s incredible journey, she too goes on a voyage of discovery, finally stepping out of the shadow of her sister and opening herself up to the possibility of love.<br /> <br /> <i>The Shadow Sister </i>is the third in the sweeping Seven Sisters series, “soaked in glamour and romance” (<i>Daily </i><i>Mail</i>) and perfect for fans of <i>Downton Abbey </i>and the novels of Kate Morton.",4.38,5:7701|4:5331|3:1529|2:180|1:70|total:14811,6829,475,,,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1482174171l/30969271._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1482174171l/30969271._SX50_.jpg,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30969271-the-shadow-sister

As a seaman, he fought in the Seminole Wars, though he saw little combat. After four years he resigned, having reached the rank of midshipman. An early success that helped launch his fame was a gritty serial story of the Bowery and slums of New York City titled The Mysteries and Miseries of New York (1851). An opinionated man, he strongly advocated nativism and temperance. Through his writing and his association with New York City's notorious gangs of the early 1800s, he was one of the instigators of the Astor Place Riot which left 23 people dead. He travelled around the country giving lectures about temperance. It was on one of these lecture tours that he encountered Buffalo Bill. His works include: The Beautiful Nun (1866) and The Scouts of the Plains (1873).",3.05,5:3|4:3|3:9|2:6|1:1|total:22,11,3,98,Dodo Press,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1409976289,9781409976288,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7277831-wild-bill-s-last-trail

Clouston,"The ordinary reader will probably be somewhat surprised to discover in the aphorisms of the ancient Greeks and Hindus several close parallels to the doctrines of the Old and New Testaments, and he will have reasoned justly if he conclude that the so-called “heathens” could have derived their spiritual light only from the same Source as that which inspired the Hebrew prophets and the Christian apostles.<br />Among English writers of aphorisms Francis Bacon, Lord Verulam, is pre-eminent, but none of his pithy sentences find place here, because they are procurable in many inexpensive forms, (e.g., Counsels from my Lord Bacon, 1892), and must be familiar to what is termed “the average general reader.” The Enchiridion of Frances Quarles and the Resolves of Owen Feltham are, however, laid under contribution, as also Robert Chamberlain, an author who is probably unknown to many pluming themselves on their thorough acquaintance with English literature, some of whose aphorisms (published in 1638, under the title of Nocturnal Lucubrations) I have deemed worthy of reproduction.",3.21,5:10|4:15|3:16|2:11|1:6|total:58,36,3,,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8217511-book-of-wise-sayings-selected-largely-from-eastern-sources
21131,9994171,Amos Huntingdon,William  Carleton,"According to Wikipedia: ""William Carleton (20 February 1794, Prillisk, Clogher, Co. Tyrone - 30 January, 1869, Sandford, Co. Dublin) was an Irish novelist... Carleton wrote from intimate acquaintance with the scenes he described, and drew with a sure hand a series of pictures of peasant life, unsurpassed for their appreciation of the passionate tenderness of Irish home life, of the buoyant humour and the domestic virtues which would, under better circumstances, bring prosperity and happiness. He alienated the sympathies of many Irishmen, however, by his unsparing criticism and occasional exaggeration of the darker side of Irish character. He was in his own words the ""historian of their habits and manners, their feelings, their prejudices, their superstitions and their crimes"" (Preface to Tales of Ireland). A second factor that alienated him from many of his Irish countrymen was his attitude towards the Catholic religion. It has been argued (for example by Brian Donnelly) that his conversion may have been a pragmatic move, as it would have been difficult for an aspiring young Catholic author to receive the degree of patronage necessary to achieve success. In 1826 he wrote a letter to the then Home Secretary Sir Robert Peel urging him against Catholic Emancipation (Peel was already an outspoken opponent), and offering to provide proof of the involvement of Daniel O'Connell in agrarian crimes, while also vilifying the Catholic clergy and Roman Catholic schoolteachers.[2] Shortly afterwards he befriended Caesar Orway, according to W. B. Yeats an ""anti-papal controversialist"" who encouraged him to write stories to ""highlight...the corrupt practices of an ignorant clergy.""",0.00,5:0|4:0|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:0,0,0,,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,2940000845073,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9994171-amos-huntingdon

21135,20715567,Nearly Lost But Dearly Won,Theodore P. Wilson,"Certainly, Mr Tankardew was not a pattern of cleanliness, either in his house or his person. Someone had said of him sarcastically, ""that there was nothing clean in his house but his towels;"" and there was a great deal of truth in the remark. He seemed to dwell in an element of cobwebs; the atmosphere in which he lived, rather than breathed, was apparently a mixture of fog and dust. Everything he had on was faded-everything that he had about him was faded-the only dew that seemed to visit the jaded-looking shrubs in the approach to his dwelling was mildew. Dilapidation and dinginess went hand-in-hand everywhere: the railings round the house were dilapidated-some had lost there points, others came to an abrupt conclusion a few inches above the stone-work from which they sprang; the steps were dilapidated-one of them rocked as you set your foot upon it, and the others sloped inwards so as to hold treacherous puddles in wet weather to entrap unwary visitors; the entrance hall was dilapidated; if ever there had been a pattern to the paper, it had now retired out of sight and given place to irregular stains, which looked something like a vast map of a desolate country, all moors and swamps; the doors were dilapidated, fitting so badly, that when the front door opened a sympathetic clatter of all the lesser ones rang through the house; the floors were dilapidated, and afforded ample convenience for easy egress and ingress to the flourishing colonies of rats and mice which had established themselves on the premises; and above all, Mr Tankardew himself was dilapidated in his dress, and in his whole appearance and habits-his very voice was dilapidated, and his words slipshod and slovenly.",0.00,5:0|4:0|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:0,0,0,90,Createspace,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1495313336,9781495313332,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20715567-nearly-lost-but-dearly-won

21137,14328511,"Parkhurst Boys, and Other Stories of School Life",Talbot Baines Reed,"Talbot Baines Reed (1852-1893) was an English writer who specialised in boys' school stories, the most famous of which were The Fifth Form at St. Dominic's (1881) and The Adventures of a Three-Guinea Watch (1883). Born in Hackney, London, Reed was the third son of Sir Charles Reed, who served as Member of Parliament for the borough. Reed's family was also closely involved with the Religious Tract Society, which founded the Boy's Own Paper, a periodical which published all of his stories. Reed more than any other late 19th century writer was responsible for the ensuing popularity of school stories in British children's fiction. Although all of Reed's school stories were first serialised in the Boy's Own Paper, some of them were published in book form, both during and after the author's life. Works include: My Friend Smith (1882), The Willoughby Captains (1883), Reginald Cruden (1885), Follow My Leader (1885), A Dog With a Bad Name (1886), The Master of the Shell (1887), Sir Ludar (1889), Roger Ingleton, Minor (1889), Tom, Dick and Harry (1892), Kilgorman (1894), Parkhurst Boys (1905) and Boycotted (1917).",4.25,5:3|4:0|3:0|2:1|1:0|total:4,1,1,300,Dodo Press,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1406537977,9781406537970,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14328511-parkhurst-boys-and-other-stories-of-school-life

For those who have wondered whether there isn’t more to Christianity than what they have known—and for those who have never considered the question—Loving God points the way to faith’s cutting edge. Here is a compelling, probing look at the cost of discipleship and the meaning of the first and greatest commandment—one that will strum a deeper, truer chord within even as it strips away the trappings of shallow, cultural Christianity. “Looking for the complete volume on Christian living? This is it. And the title sums it up.

21156,36878618,Selected Lullabies,Eugene Field,"The sweetest songs the world has ever heard are the lullabies that have been crooned above its cradles. The music of Beethoven and Mozart, of Mendelssohn and Schumann may perish, but so long as mothers sing their babies to sleep the melody of cradle lullabies will remain. Of all English and American writers the one who sang most often and most exquisitely these cradle songs was Eugene Field, the children's poet. His verses not only have charm as poetry, but a distinct song quality and a naive fancy that is both childlike and appealing. That they were written out of Eugene Field's deep and genuine love of children and out of his sympathetic understanding of their wondering minds is evident from the fact that his lullabies have taken a high and what seems to be a permanent place in the world's classic literature of childhood.

Her father, a famous musician, dies, and she is raised in the Paris Opera House with his dying promise of a protective angel of music to guide her. After a time at the opera house, she begins hearing a voice, who eventually teaches her how to sing beautifully. All goes well until Christine's childhood friend Raoul comes to visit his parents, who are patrons of the opera, and he sees Christine when she begins successfully singing on the stage. The voice, who is the deformed, murderous 'ghost' of the opera house named Erik, however, grows violent in his terrible jealousy, until Christine suddenly disappears. The phantom is in love, but it can only spell disaster.<br /><br />Leroux's work, with characters ranging from the spoiled prima donna Carlotta to the mysterious Persian from Erik's past, has been immortalized by memorable adaptations.

You're either remarkable or invisible. Make your choice. <br /><br />What do Starbucks and JetBlue and KrispyKreme and Apple and DutchBoy and Kensington and Zespri and Hard Candy have that you don't? How do they continue to confound critics and achieve spectacular growth, leaving behind former tried-and true brands to gasp their last? <br /><br />Face it, the checklist of tired 'P's marketers have used for decades to get their product noticed - Pricing, Promotion, Publicity, to name a few - aren't working anymore. There's an exceptionally important 'P' that has to be added to the list. It's Purple Cow. <br /><br />Cows, after you've seen one, or two, or ten, are boring. A Purple Cow, though...now that would be something. Purple Cow describes something phenomenal, something counterintuitive and exciting and flat out unbelievable. Every day, consumers come face to face with a lot of boring stuff-a lot of brown cows - but you can bet they won't forget a Purple Cow. And it's not a marketing function that you can slap on to your product or service. Purple Cow is inherent. It's built right in, or it's not there. Period. <br /><br />In Purple Cow, Seth Godin urges you to put a Purple Cow into everything you build, and everything you do, to create something truly noticeable. It's a manifesto for marketers who want to help create products that are worth marketing in the first place. <br /><br />Description from Amazon.com",3.75,5:12860|4:12833|3:9215|2:3217|1:2430|total:40555,38448,1032,160,Portfolio Hardcover,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1309203098l/641604._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1309203098l/641604._SX50_.jpg,159184021X,9781591840213,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/641604.Purple_Cow

There she unexpectedly confronts her feelings of love and longing as she witnesses the fitful romance between Dr. John, a handsome young Englishman, and Ginerva Fanshawe, a beautiful coquette. The first pain brings others, and with them comes the heartache Lucy has tried so long to escape.

Fortune hunters, desperadoes, horse thieves, murderers make up the frontier society, while Indians roam the plains refusing to surrender their land to the gold-hungry white men. Near lawless Clarke Bridge she sets up her practice, treating white and Indian alike, receiving horses (if anything) in return for her services.

21247,13390685,Browning's Heroines,Ethel Colburn Mayne,"PREFACE WHEN this book was projected, some one asked, What is there to say about Brownings heroines beyond what he said himself and the question, though it could not stay me, did chill momentarily my primal ardour. Soon, however, the restorative answer presented itself. If there were nothing to say about Brownings heroines beyond what he said him. For himself, it would be a bad mark against to suggest to open magic casements surely is the office of our artists in every sort thus, for them to say all that there is to say about is anything to show the casement stuck fast, as it were, and themselves battering somewhat desperately to open it. Saying the things about is the other peoples function. It is as if we suddenly saw a princess come out upon her castle-walls, and hymned that fair emergence, which to herself is nothing. Browning, I think, is coming back, as stars come back. There has been the period of obscura- tion. Seventeen years ago, when the Yellow Book and the National Observer were contending for les jeunes, Browning was, in the more precious coterie, king of modern I poets. can remember the editor of that golden Quarterly reading, declaiming, quoting, almost breathing, Browning It was from Henry Harland that this reader learnt to read The Ring and the Book Leave out the lawyers and the Tertium and all after Guido until the Envoi. It Quid, was Henry Harland who would answer, him what he was thinking of And thinking too oh, thinking, if you like, How utterly dissociated was I. . . . if one asked regardless of all aptitude in the allusion, making it simply because it burned up in his brain, just as days struck fierce mid many a day struck calm were always his days of excitement.... A hundred Browning verses sing themselves around my memories of the flat in Cromwell Road. Misconceptions was swung forth with gesture that figured swaying branches This is a spray the bird clung to. . . . You were to notice how the rhythms bent and tossed like boughs in that first stanza and to notice, also, how regrettable the second stanza was. Nor shall I easily let slip the memory of Apparent Failure, thus recited. He would begin at the second verse, the Doric little Morgue verse. You were not to miss the great phrase in The three men who did most abhor Their lives in Paris yesterday. . . . but you were to feel, scarce less keenly, the dire descent to bathos in So killed themselves. It was almost the show-example, he would tell you, of Brownings chief defect over-statement. How did it happen, my poor boy You wanted to be Bonaparte, And have the Tuileries for toy, And could not, so it broke your heart. . . . How compassionately he would give that forth A screen of glass, youre thankful for Be quiet, and unclench your fist Poor men God made, and all for this the phrases how alert we were for the phrase in those days would fall grave and vibrant from the voice with its subtle foreign colouring you could always infuriate H. H. by telling him he had a foreign accent. Those were Browning days and now these are, or soon shall be. Two or three years since, to quote him was, in the opinion of a Standard reviewer, to write yourself down a back-number, as they say. I preserve the cutting which damns with faint praise some thus antiquated short stories of 1910. Browning and Wagner were so obso- lete . . . How young that critic must have been so young that he had never seen a star return.Quite differently they come back or is it quite the same Soon we shall be able to judge, for this star is returning, and oh wonder x BROWNINGS HEROINES is trailing clouds of glory of the very newest cut...",0.00,5:0|4:0|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:0,0,0,336,Girvin Press,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1393785877l/13390685._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1393785877l/13390685._SY75_.jpg,1406779237,9781406779233,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13390685-browning-s-heroines

The theme of parental miserliness occurs in his works. At 21 he went to London to clerk for a solicitor. He then began working for a magazine called Women. When he noticed the poor material being submitted he began writing a serial for the periodical. First published in 1910. Edwin Clayhanger is the central figure in this portrayal of Victorian lower-middle-class society. As a shy young man, Edwin is bullied by his father, Darius, but he succeeds in developing his interests in spite of a restrictive environment. One of Edwin's interests is Hilda Lessways, a young woman from Staffordshire.

Ordinarily, so important a matter would have been put in the hands of one of the older men, but it happened that I was the one who had drawn up the will for Patterson Senior the night before his suicide, therefore the brunt of the work devolved upon me. The most unpleasant part of the whole affair was the notoriety. Could we have kept it from the papers, it would not have been so bad, but that was a physical impossibility; Terry Patten was on our track, and within a week he had brought down upon us every newspaper in New York.</p>",3.13,5:7|4:21|3:33|2:9|1:8|total:78,53,10,228,Book Jungle,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1604244453,9781604244458,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6317163-the-four-pools-mystery

Their descriptions of the appearance and habits of the birds they had observed were given with evident pleasure. They had a strong desire to tell what they had seen, not in the spirit of rivalry, but with the wish of adding to the knowledge of a subject in which all were equally interested. It was thought that this work would be done with even more effectiveness if a day were appointed to be celebrated as aBird Day. a With the hope of making a memorable occasion of the day for those taking part in it, several of the noted friends of birds were asked to write something to the children, and to give their opinion of the introduction of aBird Daya into the schools. a",0.00,5:0|4:0|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:0,0,0,100,Dodo Press,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1409940624,9781409940623,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10062855-bird-day

21270,8464447,"Five Hundred Dollars; Or, Jacob Marlowe's Secret",Horatio Alger Jr.,"Horatio Alger, Jr. (1832-1899) was a 19th-century American author who wrote approximately 135 novels. Many of his works have been described as rags to riches stories, illustrating how down-and-out boys might be able to achieve the American Dream of wealth and success through hard work, courage, determination, and concern for others. He is noted as a significant figure in the history of American cultural and social ideals, even though his novels are rarely read these days. After attending Harvard Divinity School from 1857 to 1860, he took a ten-month tour of Europe and produced works of a patriotic nature. Alger's empathy with the young working men, coupled with the moral values he learned at home, formed the basis of the first novel in his Ragged Dick (1867). The book was an immediate success, spurring a vast collection of sequels and similar novels, including Luck and Pluck (1869) and Tattered Tom (1871). Amongst his other works are Five Hundred Dollars; or, Jacob Marlowe's Secret (1890) and The Young Acrobat of the Great North American Circus (1900).",4.06,5:6|4:6|3:3|2:1|1:0|total:16,8,1,228,Dodo Press,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1406565458,9781406565454,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8464447-five-hundred-dollars-or-jacob-marlowe-s-secret
21271,2967726,"Chocolate: Or, an Indian Drinke",Antonio Colmenero de Ledesma,"Chocolate An Indian Drinke By Antonio Colmenero de Ledesma The history of chocolate began in Mesoamerica. Chocolate, the fermented, roasted, and ground beans of the Theobroma cacao, can be traced to the Mokaya and other pre-Olmec people, with evidence of cocoa beverages dating back to 1900 BC. Chocolate played a special role in both Mayan and Aztec royal and religious events. Priests presented cocoa beans as offerings to the gods and served cocoa drinks during sacred ceremonies. All of the areas that were conquered by the Aztecs that grew cocoa beans were ordered to pay them as a tax, or as the Aztecs called it, a ""tribute."" The Europeans sweetened and lightened the drink by adding refined sugar and milk, ingredients the people in Mesoamerica did not use. By contrast, Europeans never integrated it into their general diet, but compartmentalized its use for sweets and desserts. In the 19th century, Briton John Cadbury developed an emulsification process to make solid chocolate, creating the modern chocolate bar. To The Gentry Of The English Nation.

Born in 1759 into miserable rustic poverty, by the age of eighteen Burns had acquired a good knowledge of both classical and English literature.<br /><br />In June 1786 his first collection of verse, Poems Chiefly in the Scottish Dialect, which included 'To a Mouse' and 'The Cotter's Saturday Night', was greeted with huge acclaim by all classes of society. His later poems and ballads include 'Auld Lang Syne', the beautiful song 'My Love is like a Red Red Rose', 'Highland Mary', 'Scots Wha Hae' and his masterpiece, 'Tam o'Shanter'.",4.15,5:370|4:296|3:151|2:37|1:6|total:860,597,18,635,Wordsworth Editions,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1441621703l/131670._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1441621703l/131670._SY75_.jpg,1853264156,9781853264153,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/131670.Collected_Poems_of_Robert_Burns

21338,7847990,"The Unfortunate Traveller: Or, the Life of Jack Wilton",Thomas Nashe,"The Unfortunate Traueller: or, The Life of Jacke Wilton is a picaresque novel by Thomas Nashe first published in 1594 but set during the reign of Henry VIII of England. <br /><br />Jack Wilton adventures through the European continent and finds himself swept up in the currents of sixteenth-century history. Episodic in nature, the narrative jumps from place to place and danger to danger. <br /><br />Jack begins his tale among fellow Englishmen at a military encampment, where he swindles his superiors out of alcohol and money, framing others as traitors. Commenting by the way on the grotesque sweating sickness, Jack arrives in Munster, Germany, to observe the massacre of John Leyden's Anabaptist faction by the Emperor and the Duke of Saxony; this brutal episode enables Nashe to reflect on religious hypocrisy, a theme to which he frequently returns.<br /><br />Following the massacre of the Anabaptists at Munster, Jack Wilton has a number of personal encounters with historical figures of the sixteenth century, many of them important for their literary contributions. <br /><br />Passing into Italy, the land where the remainder of the narrative unfolds, Jack and Surrey exchange identities. The two engage in acts of deceit and trickery with pimps, prostitutes, and counterfeiters. Forced to dig themselves out of a succession of plots, the disguised Jack and Surrey assume much of the duplicitous behaviour that Italians were stereotypically known for in Renaissance England. <br /><br />Departing from Venice, Surrey and Jack arrive in Florence, the city where Geraldine was born. Surrey is overcome with poetry and speaks a sonnet in honor of her fair room, a moment in which Nashe can slyly mock the overbearing, lovesick verse of contemporary imitators of Petrarch. The copia of Surrey's verse then gives way to a tournament in which the Earl competes for his beloved's fair name, and Nashe offers gratuitous descriptions of the competitors' armor and horses in a manner that recalls printed accounts of early modern masques and other festive spectacles. The most worthy competitor, Surrey emerges from the tournament victorious, but is suddenly called back into England for business matters.<br /><br />Jack and Diamante then travel to Rome, which Jack admires for its classical ruins (he is less impressed by its religious relics). By this point in time, Jack clearly sticks out as a foreigner and a tourist, ""imitat[ing] four or five sundry nations in my attire at once."" [5] After praising the marvelous wonders of artificially-engineered gardens and lamenting the gruesome, simultaneous realities of the plague, the protagonist stumbles into one of the most memorable episodes of the narrative. Esdras of Granado and his lackey Bartol the Italian break into the house where he and Diamante are lodging, and Esdras rapes the virtuous matron Heraclide, who commits suicide after an eloquent oration. Jack witnesses the episode ""through a cranny of my upper chamber unsealed,""[6] and some critics believe this act of voyeurism makes Jack complicit in the act of rape.[7]<br /><br />Heraclide's husband accuses Jack of the rape, but another English character known as the ""Banished Earl"" stays Jack's execution. This comes at a slight cost, however; banned from his beloved home country, the Earl rattles off a catalogue of reasons to avoid travel at all costs. In Italy, one only learns ""the art of atheism, the art of epicurizing, the art of whoring, the art of poisoning, the art of sodomitry.""[8] France gains one only a knowledge of wine and the ""French disease,"" syphilis. In Spain, one only acquires strange clothing. The Dutch excel only in their drinking. Such an admonitory catalogue follows the precepts found in the writings of the Elizabethan education theorist Roger Ascham, who warned his fellow Englishmen about the dangers of Italy and its books.[9]<br /><br />In spite of the Banished English Earl's suggestions, Jack remains in Italy in search of his beloved Diamante. In so doing, he becomes entangled with and entrapped by Zadok the Jew and Zachary, the Papal Physician, who plan to use Jack as a specimen at the anatomical college. Freed from the brutal pair by the wiles of Juliana, the Pope's courtesan, Jack reunites with Diamante and robs Juliana of her goods, while Zachary flees and Zadok faces a grotesque combination of torture and execution.<br /><br />The final episode of The Unfortunate Traveller returns to the character of Esdras, who figures now as a victim. At Bologna, Jack and Diamante observe the public execution of Cutwolf, the brother of Esdras's lackey Bartol. Standing before the crowd, Cutwolf delivers a speech recounting his vile actions. Seeking vengeance for his brother's murder, Cutwolf tracked down the villain Esdras, confronted him, and forced him to blaspheme against God and against salvation before discharging a pistol into his mouth, thereby damning his soul eternally in death. Self-righteously, he declares in his own defense before the crowd that ""This is the fault that hath called me hither. No true Italian but will honour me for it. Revenge is the glory of arms and the highest performance of valour."" [10] In spite of such an oration, Cutwolf joins the ranks of the narrative's brutally-executed characters, and Jack and his newly-wed Diamante flee out of ""the Sodom of Italy"" back toward the English encampment in France, where the story first began.",2.68,5:9|4:30|3:61|2:46|1:29|total:175,85,13,264,BiblioLife,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,110312353X,9781103123537,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7847990-the-unfortunate-traveller

The eldest boy, Jim Keene, as I remember him, was a bright little fellow, but wild as an Indian and full of mischief.

  <i>I'VE NEVER BEEN THAT GIRL.</i>
</blockquote>Sixteen-year-old Ophelia Castellan will never be just another girl at Elsinore Academy. Seeing ghosts is not a skill prized in future society wives. Even when she takes her pills, the bean sidhe beckon, reminding her of a promise to her dead mother.<br /><br />Now, in the wake of the Headmaster's sudden death, the whole academy is in turmoil, and Ophelia can no longer ignore the fae. Especially once she starts seeing the Headmaster's ghosts- two of them- on the school grounds.<br /><br />At the center of her crumbling world is Dane, the Headmaster's grieving son. He, too, understands the power of a promise to a parent- even a dead one. To him, Ophelia is the only person not tainted by deceit and hypocrisy, a mirror of his own broken soul. And to Ophelia, Dane quickly becomes everything. Yet even as she gives more of herself to him, Dane slips away. Consumed by suspicion, rage, and madness, he spirals towards his tragic fate- dragging Ophelia, and the rest of Elsinore, with him.<blockquote>

21348,10883,Benjamin Franklin: An American Life,Walter Isaacson,"Benjamin Franklin is the Founding Father who winks at us. An ambitious urban entrepreneur who rose up the social ladder, from leather-aproned shopkeeper to dining with kings, he seems made of flesh rather than of marble. In bestselling author Walter Isaacson's vivid and witty full-scale biography, we discover why Franklin seems to turn to us from history's stage with eyes that twinkle from behind his new-fangled spectacles. By bringing Franklin to life, Isaacson shows how he helped to define both his own time and ours.<br /><br />He was, during his 84-year life, America's best scientist, inventor, diplomat, writer, and business strategist, and he was also one of its most practical—though not most profound—political thinkers. He proved by flying a kite that lightning was electricity, and he invented a rod to tame it. He sought practical ways to make stoves less smoky and commonwealths less corrupt. He organized neighborhood constabularies and international alliances, local lending libraries and national legislatures. He combined two types of lenses to create bifocals and two concepts of representation to foster the nation's federal compromise. He was the only man who shaped all the founding documents of America: the Albany Plan of Union, the Declaration of Independence, the treaty of alliance with France, the peace treaty with England, and the Constitution. And he helped invent America's unique style of homespun humor, democratic values, and philosophical pragmatism.<br /><br />But the most interesting thing that Franklin invented, and continually reinvented, was himself. America's first great publicist, he was, in his life and in his writings, consciously trying to create a new American archetype. In the process, he carefully crafted his own persona, portrayed it in public, and polished it for posterity.<br /><br />Through it all, he trusted the hearts and minds of his fellow ""leather-aprons"" more than he did those of any inbred elite. He saw middle-class values as a source of social strength, not as something to be derided. His guiding principle was a ""dislike of everything that tended to debase the spirit of the common people."" Few of his fellow founders felt this comfort with democracy so fully, and none so intuitively.<br /><br />In this colorful and intimate narrative, Isaacson provides the full sweep of Franklin's amazing life, from his days as a runaway printer to his triumphs as a statesman, scientist, and Founding Father. He chronicles Franklin's tumultuous relationship with his illegitimate son and grandson, his practical marriage, and his flirtations with the ladies of Paris. He also shows how Franklin helped to create the American character and why he has a particular resonance in the twenty-first century.",3.99,5:39782|4:34702|3:17381|2:5033|1:4493|total:101391,98704,1678,586,Simon & Schuster,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1397772877l/10883._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1397772877l/10883._SY75_.jpg,074325807X,9780743258074,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10883.Benjamin_Franklin

21353,10408676,Next Medicine: The Science and Civics of Health,Walter M. Bortz II,"Every year, the average American spends about $7,300 on medical expenses. The typical Canadian pays $2,700, the Briton only $2,000. And yet, according to the World Health Organization, our healthcare system, in terms of total quality, ranks thirty-eighth in the world, right between Costa Rica and Slovenia. Not only do 40 million Americans lack health insurance, but more than 200,000 die each year because of medical mistakes. Our average life expectancy is lower than Cuba's. In Next Medicine, Walter Bortz shows how the defects of American healthcare threaten the stability of our entire nation. A physician with fifty years of experience and an expert on aging, Bortz argues that the financial interests of biotech and drug companies have eroded the values of the medical profession and placed profit before human wellbeing. Heart disease, for example, is widely treated with drug interventions and invasive surgery--both of which are extravagantly profitable for pharmaceutical giants and hospitals. But daily exercise and a healthy diet can prevent heart disease altogether, and can be obtained by patients essentially for free. As such, the medical-industrial complex has a vested interest in keeping Americans sick, and until that changes medicine will fail to effectively address the leading cause of disability and mortality today: chronic diseases like diabetes that are largely preventable. Dissecting these and other symptoms of our ailing healthcare system, Bortz prescribes a potent therapy: a radical new approach to medicine that emphasizes personal responsibility and provides incentives for healthy lifestyle choices, along with a new class of medical professionals trained to promote health rather than to treat disease. Nothing less than a paradigm shift, Bortz's proposal goes far beyond the administrative tinkering proposed by politicians and special interests. Through a lively narrative full of personal anecdotes, bold ideas, and jarring",4.42,5:6|4:5|3:1|2:0|1:0|total:12,11,2,241,OUP Us,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,0195369688,9780195369687,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10408676-next-medicine

As she reaches adulthood, the clash between their expectations and her desires is painfully played out as she finds herself torn between her relationships with three very different men: her proud and stubborn brother, a close friend who is also the son of her family's worst enemy, and a charismatic but dangerous suitor. With its poignant portrayal of sibling relationships, The Mill on the Floss is considered George Eliot's most autobiographical novel; it is also one of her most powerful and moving.<br /><br />In this edition writer and critic A.S. Byatt provides full explanatory notes and an introduction relating <i>Mill on the Floss</i> to George Eliot's own life and times.<br /><br />Edited with an introduction and notes by A.S.

21380,46630267,Young Heroes of the Soviet Union: A Memoir and a Reckoning,Alex Halberstadt,"<b>Can trauma be inherited? In this luminous memoir of identity, exile, ancestry, and reckoning, an American writer returns to Russia to face a family history that still haunts him</b><br /><br />In 2013, researchers at Emory University conducted an experiment: They released a chemical compound smelling of cherry blossoms into a habitat of mice, then gave the mice an electric shock. Eventually, the mice learned to associate the scent of cherry blossoms with pain, and trembled whenever they smelled it. But the surprising part came after they had babies of their own: When exposed to that same scent, their offspring also trembled, though they'd never been shocked.<br /><br />Which raises a question: what if our lives are lived in response to evens we can neither identify nor remember, that have their origins in the decades prior to our births?<br /><br />In <i>Young Heroes of the Soviet Union, </i> Russian-American author and journalist Alex Halberstadt sets out on a quest to name and acknowledge a legacy of familial trauma, and to end a cycle of estrangement that afflicts his family. This journey leads him to track down his grandfather--one of the last living bodyguards of Joseph Stalin--and to examine the ways in which The Great Terror and decades of Soviet totalitarianism indelibly shaped three generations of his family. He goes back to Lithuania, where his Jewish mother's family was from, to revisit the trauma of the Holocaust and a pernicious legacy of anti-Semitism that has yet to be reckoned with. And he explores his own story, as a fatherless immigrant who arrived in America--to a housing project in Queens--as a twelve-year-old boy and struggled with feelings of rootlessness, identity, and yearning for home.<br /><br />As Halberstadt revisits the sites of his family's formative traumas, he uncovers a multigenerational transmission of fear, suspicion, grief, melancholy, and rage. And he comes to realize something more: that nations, too, possess formative traumas that penetrate into the most private recesses of their citizens' lives.",4.50,5:1|4:1|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:2,2,1,320,Random House,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1572494373l/46630267._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1572494373l/46630267._SY75_.jpg,1400067065,9781400067060,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46630267-young-heroes-of-the-soviet-union

His first book for boys, Peter the Whaler, was published in 1851, and had such success that he retired from business and devoted himself entirely to the production of this kind of literature, in which his popularity was deservedly great; and during 30 years he wrote upwards of 130 tales, including Digby Heathcote (1860), The Three Midshipmen (1862), The Three Lieutenants (1874), The Three Commanders (1875) and In the Rocky Mountains (1878). He also conducted various papers, including The Colonist, and Colonial Magazine and East India Review. He was also interested in emigration, volunteering, and various philanthropic schemes.

He spent most of the period of the English Civil War travelling on the European continent. In April 1649 he was elected to Parliament to fill a vacancy as MP for Abingdon. By the end of 1651 he was a member of the Council of State, but found himself so hostile to Cromwell that he temporarily retired from active politics. However, he returned to Parliament in 1656, representing Reading, having become a member of Harrington's republican group. After the Restoration, he was arrested for treasonable practices in 1663 but was released without punishment. He spent the rest of his life in quiet writing and scholarship. Neville wrote a number of satires, the best known being The Parliament of Ladies. He also published translations from Latin and Italian, including works of Machiavelli.",2.50,5:0|4:4|3:4|2:7|1:3|total:18,10,1,76,Dodo Press,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1406549797,9781406549799,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2113620.The_Isle_of_Pines

For, in spite of all that has been done during the past thirty years to increase the facilities for education and to improve the means of instruction, there is a deep-seated and widely spread feeling that, somehow or other, matters educationally are not well with us, as a nation, and that in this particular line of social development other countries have pushed forward, whilst we have been content to lag behind in the educational rear.

Il mugnaio diede un balzo e divento livido; la donna piu non sapeva in che mondo si fosse. -Presto, presto!-proruppe una voce di fuori.-Lena! tuo marito e morto. I campagnoli non usano complimenti. Elena scoppio in un urlo e corse ad aprire. -Corri!... e la presso il muro del signor conte. Morto stecchito. Ha la bocca piena di pioggia. Fu il maiale ad accopparlo. -Il maiale? un maiale? che maiale?-disse Andrea comparendo coraggiosamente dal suo buco. -Maiale o non maiale-prosegui indispettito quell'uomo, -sta il fatto che Paolino e crepato. Lena si mise a strillare, Andrea corse a veder come stesse la faccenda. La quale poi io non so come sia terminata. VII. Maometto. Maometto, col suo bell'elmo lucente in capo, si arrampico traverso i pini folti e scuri, da cui esalava acuto odore di resina. Un leggiero soffio di vento faceva dondolar quelle braccia protese in giro e tratto tratto fischiava in alto con un tono misterioso e beffardo. La Roncaglia era deserta. -Oh! oh!-mormoro Maometto.-Che il diavolo ci voglia guastare la festa?-E si fermo un momento spiando al di sopra del bosco. Tra i pini scorgevasi qualche lembo di cielo sbiadito, cinereo, uniforme, presago di temporale. Un lampo rapido rosseggio entro il padiglione dei rami: il vento crebbe. Allora Maometto raddoppio la corsa. I tronchi secchi degli abeti minacciavano di afferrargli l'elmo e portarglielo via: egli dovette premerlo su la nuca, si fermo per rendersi piu piccolo e sollevo con la sinistra il fodero dello squadrone affinche non gli impedisse le gambe.

Questo innamoramento cosi improvviso e completo, questo vivido abbandono dello spirito, e questo ardore dei sensi, egli l'avea provato un'altra volta. Aveva venti anni allora, e una giovinezza appena sfiorata da certi amoretti fugaci, da certi capricci molto intensi, ma molto brevi. Una bellissima donna gli era apparsa, allora: ma quasi vicina ai quarant'anni, espertissima della vita e delle sue passioni, ella aveva guardato con indulgenza, niente altro, il trasporto amoroso di Paolo Herz. In verita egli aveva delirato per questa donna, piu vecchia di lui di circa venti anni; egli si era rotolato sul letto, singhiozzando e mordendo i cuscini nel dolore dell'amore non corrisposto; egli aveva voluto morire, perche Beatrice Somma non voleva amarlo. Infine un giorno la bella donna si decise: fu per pieta, fu per lassezza di combattere, fu perche il suo cuore aveva subito un estremo assalto di tenerezza? Chi sa! Ella disse di si. Si rammentava bene, Paolo Herz, che ebbrezza era stata la sua, noi giorno del primo appuntamento, e come egli aveva avuto la febbre vorace dell'impazienza, spezzando il suo orologio, andando per le vie come folle. Poi... che era accaduto, poi? In un momento di maggiore impeto d'amore, donna Beatrice gli aveva detto, malinconicamente: -Non giurare, non giurare: verra giorno in cui non saprai se io sia morta o viva. Lo sapeva egli, forse, se donna Beatrice Somma fosse morta o viva? La sua passione, soddisfatta, era durata assai poco: ella l'aveva veduta finire, con viso calmo in apparenza, ma forse straziata da questo ultimo errore che aveva commesso. Era partita donna Beatrice; sparita. Morta o viva? Aveva delirato per lei: per lei aveva desiderato la morte: ma non ne sapeva nulla. Questo inaspettato ricordo gli fu increscioso. Malgrado la pienezza dell'entusiasmo amoroso che aveva per Cherie, vi era in un cantuccio del suo spirito un segreto terrore che questo...",2.67,5:1|4:6|3:8|2:12|1:3|total:30,19,2,,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,3655203322,9783655203323,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12069639-l-infedele

After 20 years singing soppy love songs, he knows that there is no such thing as romantic love. There’s only hormones and lust. At thirty-five, he’s tired of his playboy lifestyle. He wants a wife who isn’t interested in fame, money, or romance. A sensible wife, who values commitment. He wants a partnership, a friendship, and none of the craziness that goes with falling in love. As far as he can see, there’s only one way to get exactly what he wants—he needs an arranged marriage.<br /><br />…add a Scottish librarian who has given up on ever falling in love…<br /><br />Caroline Patterson terrifies men. With her no-nonsense attitude, and ice queen demeanor, she’s in control of everything—and everyone—around her.

At thirty-one, she can’t remember the last time she went on a date and is beginning to think she’ll never have a family of her own. When an American stranger buys the local castle then approaches Caroline with a marriage proposal that resembles a business contract, she quickly accepts. She doesn’t expect romance.

A few days later, they are picked up by a British ship. However, the Patna and its passengers are later also saved, and the reprehensible actions of the crew are exposed. The other participants evade the judicial court of inquiry, leaving Jim to the court alone.

Conrad is regarded as one of the greatest novelists in English, though he did not speak the language fluently until he was in his twenties. He wrote stories and novels, often with a nautical setting, that depict trials of the human spirit in the midst of an indifferent world. He was a master prose stylist who brought a distinctly non-English tragic sensibility into English literature.<br /><br />Contents: <br /><br />Lord Jim<br /><br />Memoirs &amp; Letters:<br /><br />A Personal Record; or Some Reminiscences<br /><br />The Mirror of the Sea<br /><br />Notes on Life &amp; Letters<br /><br />Biography &amp; Critical Essays:<br /><br />Joseph Conrad (A Biography) by Hugh Walpole<br /><br />Joseph Conrad by John Albert Macy<br /><br />A Conrad Miscellany by John Albert Macy<br /><br />Joseph Conrad by Virginia Woolf",3.62,5:6227|4:8688|3:7302|2:2613|1:1184|total:26014,21674,814,455,Broadview Press Inc,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1372366969l/12194._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1372366969l/12194._SY75_.jpg,1551111721,9781551111728,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12194.Lord_Jim

Somehow, she survives nearly four hours in the water before being rescued by the Coast Guard. But the boat’s owner and her professional fisherman friend, Ned, is not so lucky.<br /><br /> Compelled to look after Noah, the son of the late Ned and her alcoholic prep school friend, Thomasina, Pirio can’t shake the lurking suspicion that the boat’s sinking—and Ned’s death—was no accident. It’s a suspicion seconded by her deeply cynical, autocratic Russian father, who tells her that nothing is ever what it seems. Then the navy reaches out to her to participate in research on human survival in dangerously cold temperatures.<br /><br /> With the help of a curious journalist named Russell Parnell, Pirio begins unraveling a lethal plot involving the glacial whaling grounds off Baffin Island. In a narrow inlet in the arctic tundra, Pirio confronts her ultimate challenge: to trust herself. <br /><br /> A gripping literary thriller, <i>North of Boston </i>combines the atmospheric chills of Jussi Adler-Olsen with the gritty mystery of Laura Lippman.

Quatermain has lost his only son and longs to get back into the wilderness. Having persuaded Sir Henry Curtis, Captain John Good, and the Zulu chief Umbopa to accompany him, they set out from the coast of east Africa, this time in search of a white race reputed to live north of Mount Kenya. They survive fierce encounters with Masai warriors, undergo a terrifying subterranean journey, and discover a lost civilization before being caught up in a passionate love-triangle that engulfs the country in a ferocious civil war. This novel is based on author's own experience in the African continent.<br /><br />Excerpt:<br />'I have just buried my boy, my poor handsome boy of whom I was so proud, and my heart is broken. It is very hard having only one son to lose him thus, but God's will be done. Who am I that I should complain? The great wheel of Fate rolls on like a Juggernaut, and crushes us all in turn, some soon, some late it does not matter when, in the end, it crushes us all. We do not prostrate ourselves before it like the poor Indians; we fly hither and thither we cry for mercy; but it is of no use, the black Fate thunders on and in its season reduces us to powder. 'Poor Harry to go so soon! just when his life was opening to him. He was doing so well at the hospital, he had passed his last examination with honours, and I was proud of them, much prouder than he was, I think. And then he must needs go to that smallpox hospital. He wrote to me that he was not afraid of smallpox and wanted to gain the experience; and now the disease has killed him, and I, old and grey and withered, am left to mourn over him, without a chick or child to comfort me. I might have saved him, too-I have money enough for both of us, and much more than enough-King Solomon's Mines provided me with that; but I said, ""No, let the boy earn his living, let him labour that he may enjoy rest.""

In this volume, she paints an intimate picture of the ""Wild West,"" writing eloquently of flora and fauna, isolated settlers and assorted refugees from civilization, vigilance committees and lynchings, and crude table manners yet a gentle civility — even chivalry — among the men she encountered in the wilderness.

Indeed, a more good-natured, laughing, happy set of people it would be difficult to find. Right jovial was the rattle of tongues and the cachinnation which went forward whenever we were assembled together either at breakfast or dinner or supper; our father and mother setting us the example, so that we began the day with a hearty laugh, and finished it with a heartier. ""Laugh and grow fat"" is an apothegm which all people cannot follow, but our mother did in the most satisfactory manner.",3.75,5:1|4:2|3:0|2:1|1:0|total:4,0,0,160,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1514762730,9781514762738,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27721998-marmaduke-merry

Let us pause and contemplate that scene. What grandeur and sublimity there is in it! What a magnificent edifice does it seem! When compared with it, how utterly insignificant and contemptible do all the works of man's hands appear! Then watch the sun sink with rays of glory in the west; the bright rich tinge glowing for a time, and gradually fading away before the obscurity of night; the stars coming forth and shining with a splendour unknown in northern climes; and then the moon, a mass of liquid flame, rising out of the dark sea, and casting across it a broad path of the silvery light.",0.00,5:0|4:0|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:0,0,0,192,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1511561319,9781511561310,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27668271-mark-seaworth

His mother kept an apple-stall at Portsmouth, and his father was part owner of a wherry; but even by their united efforts, in fine weather, they found it hard work to feed and clothe their numerous offspring. Sometimes Sunshine Bill's father was laid up with illness, and sometimes his mother was so; and occasionally he and his brothers and sisters were sick also. Sometimes they had the measles, or small-pox, or a fever; and then there was the doctor to pay, and medicine to buy; consequently, at the end of these visitations, the family cash-box, consisting of an old stocking in a cracked basin, kept on the highest shelf of their sitting-room, was generally empty, and they considered themselves fortunate if they were not in debt besides. Still, no one ever heard them complain, or saw them quarrel, or beat their children, as some people do when things do not go straight with them; nor did their children ever fight among themselves. Even, indeed, in the worst of times, Sunshine Bill's mother managed to find a crust of bread and a bit of cheese, to keep the family from starving. To be sure, she and her husband could not give their children much of an education, as far as school learning was concerned. They themselves, in spite of all trials, were never cast down; and they taught Bill, and his brothers and sisters, to follow their example. They said that God had always been kind to them, and that they were sure He would not change while they tried to do their duty and please Him.",0.00,5:0|4:0|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:0,0,0,72,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1400892725l/22297544._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1400892725l/22297544._SX50_.jpg,1499349483,9781499349481,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22297544-sunshine-bill

The father, ""peeling his orange flight-suit halfway down, a snake shedding skin…'I lost him,' …'My boy has augured in'…intermittent streetlights staining his warm, wet face.""<br /> <br />Tectonic violence jerks the ground under these poems. Recurring images of smoke, ash, volcanic eruptions, and what we see in the plumes create an ominous and contested beauty: ""Spirit, what do you want?/What do you want me to know/among these yellow leaves?"" contrasts with hollow despair: ""That plume is a woman/who just couldn't take any more—""<br /> <br />As the collection progresses, the images begin to cohere into a larger skyscape of un-easy forgiveness. There are no shortcuts here, no platitudes in place of real integration: ""Whatever we say no to/comes back and sticks/to us a little bit"" … ""And herein lies the revocation,/the cancellation of the debt"". In the final piece of the collection, ""Farewell Poem to a Living Father,"" Churchill-Dicks closes the journey precisely where and how it must be closed: ""take this folded paper/and give it to the boatman/when he asks you/if you were loved.""<br /> <br />Few writers have either the courage or the capacity for specificity that is required to tell the complex truth of a family's immense cruelties, or its fragile loves. In Wine-Dark Mother and the Trapper's Son, Churchill-Dicks reminds us of the fact that in Jewish tradition, witness is an active verb; a difficult praxis and a real action toward reconstituting the world and making whole what was scattered. In these poems' reconstitution of memory, soul, and family, we are enabled to more fiercely and truly witness our own.<br /> - Jessamyn Smyth, author of The Inugami Mochi and Kitsune",4.56,5:6|4:2|3:1|2:0|1:0|total:9,9,5,62,Musehick Publications,en-US,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1463187640l/30173422._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1463187640l/30173422._SX50_.jpg,1944864024,9781944864026,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30173422-wine-dark-mother-and-the-trapper-s-son

Luce, a mermaid with exceptionally threatening abilities, becomes their number-one target, hunted as she flees down the coast toward San Francisco. <br /><br />There she finds hundreds of mermaids living in exile under the docks of the bay. These are the Twice Lost: once-human girls lost first when a trauma turned them into mermaids, and lost a second time when they broke mermaid law and were rejected by their tribes.

The many thousands of books in our collection have been sourced from libraries and private collections around the world.The titles that Trieste Publishing has chosen to be part of the collection have been scanned to simulate the original. Our readers see the books the same way that their first readers did decades or a hundred or more years ago.

It is highly unlikely that this would occur with one of our books. Our extensive quality control ensures that the readers of Trieste Publishing's books will be delighted with their purchase. Our staff has thoroughly reviewed every page of all the books in the collection, repairing, or if necessary, rejecting titles that are not of the highest quality. This process ensures that the reader of one of Trieste Publishing's titles receives a volume that faithfully reproduces the original, and to the maximum degree possible, gives them the experience of owning the original work.We pride ourselves on not only creating a pathway to an extensive reservoir of books of the finest quality, but also providing value to every one of our readers.

His seventh and last novel, it tells the story of Gregory Gryll, a descendant of the ancient and noble Gryllus who, for lack of better options, chooses his niece to be his heir. However, Gryll's plan falls short when his new heir finds it difficult to find a man to her particular tastes.<br /><br />Thomas Love Peacock (18 October 1785 - 23 January 1866) was an English poet, novelist, and important figure in the East India Company. A good friend of Percy Bysshe Shelley, they both had a significant influence on each other's work. Peacock was most famous for writing satirical novels, which usually involved characters sat around a table discussing contemporary philosophical ideas.

21520,8921,"The Hound of the Baskervilles (Sherlock Holmes, #5)",Arthur Conan Doyle,"We owe <i>The Hound of the Baskervilles</i> (1902) to Arthur Conan Doyle's good friend Fletcher ""Bobbles"" Robinson, who took him to visit some scary English moors and prehistoric ruins, and told him marvelous local legends about escaped prisoners and a 17th-century aristocrat who fell afoul of the family dog. Doyle transmogrified the legend: generations ago, a hound of hell tore out the throat of devilish Hugo Baskerville on the moonlit moor. Poor, accursed Baskerville Hall now has another mysterious death: that of Sir Charles Baskerville. Could the culprit somehow be mixed up with secretive servant Barrymore, history-obsessed Dr. Frankland, butterfly-chasing Stapleton, or Selden, the Notting Hill murderer at large? Someone's been signaling with candles from the mansion's windows. Nor can supernatural forces be ruled out. Can Dr. Watson--left alone by Sherlock Holmes to sleuth in fear for much of the novel--save the next Baskerville, Sir Henry, from the hound's fangs?<p> Many Holmes fans prefer Doyle's complete short stories, but their clockwork logic doesn't match the author's boast about this novel: it's ""a real Creeper!"" What distinguishes this particular <i>Hound</i> is its fulfillment of Doyle's great debt to Edgar Allan Poe--it's full of ancient woe, low moans, a Grimpen Mire that sucks ponies to Dostoyevskian deaths, and locals digging up Neolithic skulls without next-of-kins' consent. ""The longer one stays here the more does the spirit of the moor sink into one's soul,"" Watson realizes. ""Rank reeds and lush, slimy water-plants sent an odour of decay ... while a false step plunged us more than once thigh-deep into the dark, quivering mire, which shook for yards in soft undulations around our feet ... it was as if some malignant hand was tugging us down into those obscene depths.""

""How in Tartarus,"" cried Flambeau, ""did you ever hear of the spiked bracelet?"" -- ""Oh, one's little flock, you know!"" said Father Brown, arching his eyebrows rather blankly. ""When I was a curate in Hartlepool, there were three of them with spiked bracelets."" <br />Not long after he published <i>Orthodoxy,</i> G. K. Chesterton moved from London to Beaconsfield, and met Father O'Connor. O'Connor had a shrewd insight to the darker side of man's nature and a mild appearance to go with it--and together those came together to become Chesterton's unassuming Father Brown. Chesterton loved the character, and the magazines he wrote for loved the stories. <i>The Innocence of Father Brown</i> was the first collection of them, and it's a great lot of fun.",3.85,5:3529|4:4519|3:3148|2:777|1:226|total:12199,10020,563,232,Wildside Press,eng,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,0809592533,9780809592531,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/184591.The_Innocence_of_Father_Brown

Se voyant entoure, il jeta son habit galonne et gagna la riviere. Le pied lui manqua sur une pierre et il tomba sur le rivage. Se relevant aussitot, il s'assit immobile et attendit Menopoide, le guerrier Pequot, qui n'eut pas le courage de l'attaquer. Le premier Anglais qui l'approcha fut un jeune homme du nom de Robert Santon. Le Sachem lui dit un peu dedaigneusement, et en mauvais anglais: You much chile, no understand war; let your Chief come. Il se rendit a Dennison. Conduit a Stomington, il y fut fusille. Les Mohicans tirerent, les Pequots l'ecartelerent, et les Niantics allumerent son bucher. Sa tete fut presentee en plein conseil a Hartford. Ainsi finit, a la fleur de l'age, le dernier des Narraghansetts, le petit neveu de Cananacus, et le fils de Miantonimo. Ses ennemis, exasperes par leurs desastres, le vouerent a la mort. Ainsi les Romains firent perir Jugurtha, qui mourut dans le cachot de Tullianum. Aujourd'hui que la passion de l'epoque est affaiblie, il est permis de pleurer sur le sort de ce noble enfant de l'Amerique du Nord. L'histoire indigene n'offre pas un plus bel exemple de cette generosite chevaleresque avec laquelle l'interessant Conanchel accorda sa protection aux faibles, sacrifia sa puissance et sa liberte a l'honneur, et fut fidele a la voix de ses ancetres.

He is now known particularly for the semi-autobiographical novel Mr Midshipman Easy (1836) and his children's novel The Children of the New Forest (1847). After trying to run away to sea several times, he was permitted to enter the Royal Navy in 1806, as a midshipman on board HMS Imperieuse. In 1829 he was commanding the frigate HMS Ariadne on a mission to search for shoals around the Madeira and Canary Islands. This was an uninspiring exercise, and between that and the recent publication of his first novel, The Naval Officer (1829) he decided to resign his commission and take up writing full time. Other works include The King's Own (1830), Newton Forster; or, The Merchant Service (1832), Peter Simple, and The Three Cutters (1834), Jacob Faithful (1834), The Pacha of Many Tales (1835), Japhet, in Search of a Father (1836), The Pirate (1836), The Phantom Ship (1839), Poor Jack (1840), Masterman Ready (1841), Percival Keene (1842), The Privateersman (1846) and The Mission; or, Scenes in Africa (1845).",2.92,5:1|4:2|3:6|2:3|1:1|total:13,5,1,316,Dodo Press,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1406556548,9781406556544,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7000448-the-mission-or-scenes-in-africa

21575,7146506,Poor Jack,Frederick Marryat,"Captain Frederick Marryat (1792-1848) was an English novelist, a contemporary and acquaintance of Charles Dickens, noted today as an early pioneer of the sea story. He is now known particularly for the semi-autobiographical novel Mr Midshipman Easy (1836) and his children's novel The Children of the New Forest (1847). After trying to run away to sea several times, he was permitted to enter the Royal Navy in 1806, as a midshipman on board HMS Imperieuse. In 1829 he was commanding the frigate HMS Ariadne on a mission to search for shoals around the Madeira and Canary Islands. This was an uninspiring exercise, and between that and the recent publication of his first novel, The Naval Officer (1829) he decided to resign his commission and take up writing full time. Other works include The King's Own (1830), Newton Forster; or, The Merchant Service (1832), Peter Simple, and The Three Cutters (1834), Jacob Faithful (1834), The Pacha of Many Tales (1835), Japhet, in Search of a Father (1836), The Pirate (1836), The Phantom Ship (1839), Poor Jack (1840), Masterman Ready (1841), Percival Keene (1842), The Privateersman (1846) and The Mission; or, Scenes in Africa (1845).",3.92,5:6|4:11|3:8|2:0|1:0|total:25,15,2,,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,2940003756796,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7146506-poor-jack

21585,2998,The Secret Garden,Frances Hodgson Burnett,"""One of the most delightful and enduring classics of children's literature, The Secret Garden by Victorian author Frances Hodgson Burnett has remained a firm favorite with children the world over ever since it made its first appearance. Initially published as a serial story in 1910 in The American Magazine, it was brought out in novel form in 1911. <br /> <br />The plot centers round Mary Lennox, a young English girl who returns to England from India, having suffered the immense trauma by losing both her parents in a cholera epidemic. However, her memories of her parents are not pleasant, as they were a selfish, neglectful and pleasure-seeking couple. Mary is given to the care of her uncle Archibald Craven, whom she has never met. She travels to his home, Misselthwaite Manor located in the gloomy Yorkshire, a vast change from the sunny and warm climate she was used to. When she arrives, she is a rude, stubborn and given to stormy temper tantrums. However, her nature undergoes a gradual transformation when she learns of the tragedies that have befallen her strict and disciplinarian uncle whom she earlier feared and despised. Once when he's away from home, Mary discovers a charming walled garden which is always kept locked. The mystery deepens when she hears sounds of sobbing from somewhere within her uncle's vast mansion. The kindly servants ignore her queries or pretend they haven't heard, spiking Mary's curiosity. <br /> <br />The Secret Garden appeals to both young and old alike. It has wonderful elements of mystery, spirituality, charming characters and an authentic rendering of childhood emotions and experiences. Commonsense, truth and kindness, compassion and a belief in the essential goodness of human beings lie at the heart of this unforgettable story. It is the best known of Frances Hodgson Burnett's works, though most of us have definitely heard of, if not read, her other novel Little Lord Fauntleroy. <br /> <br />The book has been adapted extensively on stage, film and television and translated into all the world's major languages. In 1991, a Japanese anime version was launched for television in Japan. It remains a popular and beloved story of a child's journey into maturity, and a must-read for every child, parent, teacher and anyone who would enjoy this fascinating glimpse of childhood. One of the most delightful and enduring classics of children's literature, The Secret Garden by Victorian author Frances Hodgson Burnett has remained a firm favorite with children the world over ever since it made its first appearance.

21589,732562,The Rime of the Ancient Mariner,Samuel Taylor Coleridge,"<i>The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</i> (originally ""The Rime of the Ancyent Marinere"") is the longest major poem by the English poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, written in 1797–98 and published in 1798 in the first edition of <i>Lyrical Ballads</i>. Modern editions use a later revised version printed in 1817 and featuring a gloss. Along with other poems in <i>Lyrical Ballads</i>, it was a signal shift to modern poetry and the beginning of British Romantic literature.<br /><br />It relates the events experienced by a mariner who has returned from a long sea voyage. The Mariner stops a man on his way to a wedding ceremony and begins to narrate a story. The Wedding-Guest's reaction turns from bemusement to impatience, fear, and fascination as the Mariner's story progresses, as can be seen in the language style: for example, the use of narrative techniques such as personification and repetition to create a sense of danger, or the supernatural, or serenity, depending on the mood each different part of the poem.",3.94,5:17901|4:16764|3:11580|2:3255|1:960|total:50460,43871,692,77,Dover Publications,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1436976206l/732562._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1436976206l/732562._SX50_.jpg,0486223051,9780486223056,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/732562.The_Rime_of_the_Ancient_Mariner

21601,112510,The Vicar of Wakefield,Oliver Goldsmith,"Oliver Goldsmith's hugely successful novel of 1766 remained for generations one of the most highly regarded and beloved works of eighteenth-century fiction. It depicts the fall and rise of the Primrose family, presided over by the benevolent vicar, the narrator of a fairy-tale plot of impersonation and deception, the abduction of a beautiful heroine and the machinations of an aristocratic villain. By turns comic and sentimental, the novel's popularity owes much to its recognizable depiction of domestic life and loving family relationships.<br /><br />New to this edition is an introduction by Robert L. Mack that examines the reasons for the novels enduring popularity, as well as the critical debates over whether it is a straightforward novel of sentiment or a satire on the social and economic inequalities of the period and the very literary conventions and morality it seems to embody. This edition also includes a new, up-to-date bibliography and expanded notes, and contains reprints of Arthur Friedman's authoritative Oxford English Novels text of the corrected first edition of 1766.",3.48,5:1657|4:2537|3:3176|2:1060|1:309|total:8739,7847,323,197,Oxford University Press,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,0192805126,9780192805126,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/112510.The_Vicar_of_Wakefield

Now, in a tour-de-force narrative twenty years in the making, Ashton leads us on a journey through humanity’s greatest creations to uncover the surprising truth behind who creates and how they do it. From the crystallographer’s laboratory where the secrets of DNA were first revealed by a long forgotten woman, to the electromagnetic chamber where the stealth bomber was born on a twenty-five-cent bet, to the Ohio bicycle shop where the Wright brothers set out to “fly a horse,” Ashton showcases the seemingly unremarkable individuals, gradual steps, multiple failures, and countless ordinary and usually uncredited acts that lead to our most astounding breakthroughs.<br /><br />Creators, he shows, apply in particular ways the everyday, ordinary thinking of which we are all capable, taking thousands of small steps and working in an endless loop of problem and solution. He examines why innovators meet resistance and how they overcome it, why most organizations stifle creative people, and how the most creative organizations work. Drawing on examples from art, science, business, and invention, from Mozart to the Muppets, Archimedes to Apple, Kandinsky to a can of Coke, <i>How to Fly a Horse</i> is a passionate and immensely rewarding exploration of how “new” comes to be.",4.04,5:543|4:610|3:285|2:70|1:21|total:1529,1196,192,,,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1417408497l/20342540._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1417408497l/20342540._SY75_.jpg,0385538596,9780385538596,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20342540-how-to-fly-a-horse

Hoare Doubtless some of our readers are acquainted with the noble ""coast road"" that skirts round the north-eastern corner of Ireland, extending, it might almost be said, from Belfast to Londonderry. The characteristic features of this noble esplanade (for such it is) are chiefly to be seen between the little town of Larne, where the railway ends, and Cushendall. Throughout this drive of forty miles you are never out of sight or sound of the sea. The almost level road is seen far ahead of the traveller, like a white boundary line between cliff and wave. You wonder at first if the road was made merely to gladden the tourist, for it does not seem likely that there could be much traffic other than that of pleasure-seekers thus along the margin of the sea. The configuration of this part of the County Antrim, however, explains the position of the road, and justifies the engineer who was so happily enabled to combine the utilitarian with the romantic. A series of deep cut gorges, locally known as ""The Glens,"" intersect the country, running at right angles to the coast-line and thus forming a succession of gigantic ridges, over which it would be impossible to drive a road.... We are delighted to publish this classic book as part of our extensive Classic Library collection.

21614,46790207,For the Temple: A Tale of the Fall of Jerusalem,G.A. Henty,"George Alfred Henty (8 December 1832 - 16 November 1902) was a prolific English novelist and war correspondent. He is best known for his historical adventure stories that were popular in the late 19th century. His works include The Dragon &amp; The Raven (1886), For The Temple (1888), Under Drake's Flag (1883) and In Freedom's Cause (1885).<br /><br />G. A. Henty was born in Trumpington, near Cambridge. He was a sickly child who had to spend long periods in bed. During his frequent illnesses he became an avid reader and developed a wide range of interests which he carried into adulthood. He attended Westminster School, London, and later Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he was a keen sportsman. He left the university early without completing his degree to volunteer for the Army Hospital Commissariat when the Crimean War began. He was sent to the Crimea and while there he witnessed the appalling conditions under which the British soldier had to fight. His letters home were filled with vivid descriptions of what he saw. His father was impressed by his letters and sent them to The Morning Advertiser newspaper which printed them. This initial writing success was a factor in Henty's later decision to accept the offer to become a special correspondent, the early name for journalists now better known as war correspondents.<br /><br />Henty once related in an interview how his storytelling skills grew out of tales told after dinner to his children. He wrote his first children's book, Out on the Pampas in 1868, naming the book's main characters after his children. The book was published by Griffith and Farran in November 1870 with a title page date of 1871. While most of the 122 books he wrote were for children, he also wrote adult novels, non-fiction such as The March to Magdala and Those Other Animals, short stories for the likes of The Boy's Own Paper and edited the Union Jack, a weekly boy's magazine.<br /><br />Henty usually researched his novels by ordering several books on the subject he was writing on from libraries, and consulting them before beginning writing. Some of his books were written about events (such as the Crimean War) that he witnessed himself; hence, these books are written with greater detail as Henty drew upon his first-hand experiences of people, places, and events.<br /><br />On 16 November 1902, Henty died aboard his yacht in Weymouth Harbour, Dorset, leaving unfinished his last novel, By Conduct and Courage, which was completed by his son Captain C.G. Henty.<br /><br />Henty is buried in Brompton Cemetery, London.

21634,466449,"The Life and Adventures of Nat Love, Better Known in the Cattle Country as ""Deadwood Dick""",Nat Love,"Thousands of black cowpunchers drove cattle up the Chisholm Trail after the Civil War, but only Nat Love wrote about his experiences. Born to slaves in Davidson County, Tennessee, the newly freed Love struck out for Kansas after the war. He was fifteen and already endowed with a reckless and romantic readiness. In wide-open Dodge City he joined up with an outfit from the Texas Panhandle to begin a career riding the range and fighting Indians, outlaws, and the elements. Years later he would say, “I had an unusually adventurous life.” That was rare understatement. More characteristic was Love’s claim: “I carry the marks of fourteen bullet wounds on different parts of my body, most any one of which would be sufficient to kill an ordinary man, but I am not even crippled.” In 1876 a virtuoso rodeo performance in Deadwood, Dakota Territory, won him the moniker of Deadwood Dick. He became known as DD all over the West, entering into dime novels as a mysteriously dark and heroic presence. This vivid autobiography includes encounters with Bat Masterson and Billy the Kid, a soon-after view of the Custer battlefield, and a successful courtship. Love left the range in 1890, the year of the official closing of the frontier. Then, as a Pullman train conductor he traveled his old trails, and those good times bring his story to a satisfying end.",3.67,5:27|4:43|3:45|2:12|1:0|total:127,87,18,162,University of Nebraska Press,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328819645l/466449._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328819645l/466449._SY75_.jpg,0803279558,9780803279551,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/466449.The_Life_and_Adventures_of_Nat_Love_Better_Known_in_the_Cattle_Country_as_Deadwood_Dick_

21651,18037914,Los muertos mandan,Vicente Blasco Ibáñez,"Los muertos mandan fue escrita por Vicente Blasco Ibáñez en 1908. El escritor considera esta novela como parte de una nueva etapa de su vida cuando se instala en Madrid. Allí conoció una dama chilena, doña Elena Ortúzar esposa de un agregado comercial de la embajada de Chile. Doña Elena marcó de forma decisiva su vida. El escritor la visitaría constantemente en París, donde ésta se estableció con su esposo. Blasco menciona el cambio en su evolución literaria que ocurre durante sus viajes regulares entre Madrid y París en una carta: ?Por aventuras particulares de mi vida viví entonces temporadas cortas y numerosas en París. Me iba de Madrid a París como el que toma el tranvía. Y a este continuo cambio de ambiente mental atribuyo estas tres novelas, que empezaron a marcar en su factura la novela tal como la hago actualmente?. Las novelas a las que se refiere son La maja desnuda (1906), Sangre y arena (1908) y Los muertos mandan (1909). Ésta novelas ofrecen una faz muy diferente de las novelas de tendencia que Vicente Blasco Ibáñez escribía antes. En su nueva etapa el escritor concentra su interés en el estudio de la interioridad de sus personajes, por lo que no resulta extraño que estas tres novelas sean conocidas como novelas psicológicas. Estas novelas están vinculadas además por la constante temática amorosa que constituye el eje primordial en torno al que se construye el relato.",3.65,5:5|4:9|3:7|2:0|1:2|total:23,5,0,259,Linkgua Ediciones,spa,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1371440065l/18037914._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1371440065l/18037914._SX50_.jpg,8499533183,9788499533186,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18037914-los-muertos-mandan

In a highly original book, classicist and cultural historian Richard Jenkyns teaches us to look at this microcosm of history with new eyes.",3.84,5:11|4:15|3:8|2:3|1:1|total:38,26,2,224,Harvard University Press,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,0674017161,9780674017160,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2139907.Westminster_Abbey

He didn’t want or need anything else in his life.<br /><br />Until the band parted ways and he found himself no longer living the dream. <br /><br />Bored and lonely, with too much time and money on his hands, Matt turns to his best friend, Alex Clark, to help devise a new direction to take his life in.

21677,15997,Paradise Lost,John Milton,"John Milton's <i>Paradise Lost</i> is one of the greatest epic poems in the English language. It tells the story of the Fall of Man, a tale of immense drama and excitement, of rebellion and treachery, of innocence pitted against corruption, in which God and Satan fight a bitter battle for control of mankind's destiny. The struggle rages across three worlds - heaven, hell, and earth - as Satan and his band of rebel angels plot their revenge against God. At the center of the conflict are Adam and Eve, who are motivated by all too human temptations but whose ultimate downfall is unyielding love.<br /><br />Marked by Milton's characteristic erudition, Paradise Lost is a work epic both in scale and, notoriously, in ambition. For nearly 350 years, it has held generation upon generation of audiences in rapt attention, and its profound influence can be seen in almost every corner of Western culture.",3.81,5:39758|4:37773|3:28452|2:10186|1:4574|total:120743,110264,2497,453,Penguin Classics,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1526070678l/15997._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1526070678l/15997._SY75_.jpg,0140424393,9780140424393,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15997.Paradise_Lost

21691,140963,"O Pioneers! (Great Plains Trilogy, #1)",Willa Cather,"<i>O Pioneers!</i> (1913) was Willa Cather's first great novel, and to many it remains her unchallenged masterpiece. No other work of fiction so faithfully conveys both the sharp physical realities and the mythic sweep of the transformation of the American frontier—and the transformation of the people who settled it. Cather's heroine is Alexandra Bergson, who arrives on the wind-blasted prairie of Hanover, Nebraska, as a girl and grows up to make it a prosperous farm. But this archetypal success story is darkened by loss, and Alexandra's devotion to the land may come at the cost of love itself.<br /><br />At once a sophisticated pastoral and a prototype for later feminist novels, <i>O Pioneers!</i> is a work in which triumph is inextricably enmeshed with tragedy, a story of people who do not claim a land so much as they submit to it and, in the process, become greater than they were.",3.86,5:12656|4:16622|3:10047|2:2603|1:1090|total:43018,36974,2127,159,Vintage,eng,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,0679743626,9780679743620,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/140963.O_Pioneers_

Although decidedly inelegant and unhandsome, this specimen of the human family was by no means uninteresting. He was so large, and his legs were so long, that the contrast between him and the little mule which he bestrode was ridiculous.

It is translated from the Icelandic. On perceiving the intention of the Danes to attack him, Erling's heart was glad, because he now felt sure that to some extent he had them in his power. If they had, on his first appearance, taken to their ships, they might have easily escaped, or some of the smaller vessels might have pulled up the river and attacked his ship, which, in that case, would have had to meet them on unequal terms; but, now that they were about to attack him on land, he knew that he could keep them in play as long as he pleased, and that if they should, on the appearance of reinforcements, again make for their ships, he could effectively harass them, and retard their embarkation.<br /><br />We are delighted to publish this classic book as part of our extensive Classic Library collection.

21742,6408771,Jarwin and Cuffy,R.M. Ballantyne,"Excerpt: ""In all the wide expanse of ocean that surrounded that island, there was nothing visible save one small, solitary speck on the far-off horizon. It might have been mistaken for a seagull, but it was in reality a raft-a mass of spars and planks rudely bound together with ropes. A boat's mast rose from the centre of it, on which hung a rag of sail, and a small red flag drooped motionless from its summit. There were a few casks on the highest part of the raft, but no living soul was visible. Nevertheless, it was not without tenants. In a hollow between two of the spars, under the shadow of one of the casks, lay the form of a man. The canvas trousers, cotton shirt, blue jacket, and open necktie, bespoke him a sailor, but it seemed as though there were nothing left save the dead body of the unfortunate tar, so pale and thin and ghastly were his features. A terrier dog lay beside him, so shrunken that it looked like a mere scrap of door-matting. Both man and dog were apparently dead, but they were not so in reality, for, after lying about an hour quite motionless, the man slowly opened his eyes.

21747,6267545,The Lonely Island: The Refuge of the Mutineers,R.M. Ballantyne,"In this story, the follow-up look at what happened with the escaped mutineers of the famous ship the H.M.S. Bounty. It begins with a recounting of the famous mutiny and the casting adrift of Captain Bligh instigated by Fletcher Christian and his comrades due to severe treatment of the men by the infamous Captain. After a brief stay on the island of Otaheite the mutineers finally resolve to find an uninhabited remote island to spend the rest of their days hopefully without being found, enjoying peace and quiet. This being decided, the men and their Otaheitian wives, along with six native men, left in search of an island to colonize. For more than 20 years they remained on the island and were not heard of. The choice for their settlement was Pitcairn s Island, far off the beaten sailing routes of ships at sea. In this intriguing story, learn about what befell these men, their settlement, the consequences of their actions, and how men without a reliance and faith in Jesus Christ, left to their own devises, will not experience peace and success. But, when the powerful work of God begins, change is remarkable: a 20-year redemption story in the making. So the good seed sown under such peculiar circumstances at the beginning of the century continues to grow and spread and flourish, bringing forth fruit to the glory of God. Thus He causes light to spring out of darkness, good to arise out of evil, and The Lonely Island, once an almost unknown rock in the Pacific Ocean, was made a center of blessed Christian influence soon after the time when it became the refuge of the mutineers.

They claimed it was an act of self-defence, their only means of stopping the violent rampage of their drunk and abusive leader. Sir George Simpson, the HBC's Overseas Governor, took the men of Stikine at their word, and the Company closed the book on the matter. The case never saw the inside of a courtroom, and no one was ever charged or punished for the crime. To this day, the killing remains the Honourable Company's dirtiest unaired laundry and one of the darkest pages in the annals of our nation's history. Now, exhaustive archival research and modern forensic science - including ballistics, virtual autopsy, and crime scene reconstruction - unlock the mystery of what really happened the night McLoughlin died.<br /><br />Using her formidable talents as a writer, researcher, and forensic scientist, Debra Komar weaves a tale that could almsot be fiction, with larger-than-life characters and dramatic tension.

Shall you get any readers if you do not admit educational failure thus far, and proceed to discuss a change of front, made imperative by recent revelations?

They play pranks on one another and have great fun. They are good natured and jolly, and rarely get angry. But if one does get angry, he quickly recovers his good nature and joins again in the sport.<br /><br />If a Goblin should continue angry he would take on some visible form. Perhaps he would become a toad or a squirrel, or some other little animal, and would have to live here on the Earth-plane forevermore. But, if he keeps good natured, he can come here and have his fun, and not be seen by any one except a Seer, or very wise person.<br /><br />The Goblins are gracious to the wise people now, but they were not always so. A long, long time ago, on a Christmas-eve, the Fairy-folk were having great sport. All the little people of the Unseen-world had gathered together in the Earth-realm. There were Brownies, and Gnomes, and Elves; even some little Cherubs had joined them. They were having a wild dance and a gay time when who should appear but Kris Kringle! Now the Fairies did not know that he was a Magician, or Seer, and so they tried to make sport of him. But Kris by his wonderful magic, changed them into the most beautiful toys. They became straight little jumping-jacks, and dolls in bright dresses, and the dearest little rabbit with white, soft fur. And somewhere in the bottom of the sleigh one was turned into a cute little Teddy-bear. Then old Kris tucked all these toys into his roomy sleigh, and shook the reins of his waiting steed. ""Go on!"" he said, ""For I've many, many a chimney to reach tonight.""<br /><br />Now this is the tale of ""The Goblins' Christmas"" that the moonbeams told, as they heard it from the Fairy-Queen, who declares that every word of it is perfectly true.-- </p>",3.27,5:4|4:0|3:7|2:4|1:0|total:15,7,1,,,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1356089920l/5957749._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1356089920l/5957749._SX50_.jpg,0548614164,9780548614167,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5957749-the-goblins-christmas

21809,1953,A Tale of Two Cities,Charles Dickens,"<b>
  <i>'Liberty, equality, fraternity, or death; -- the last, much the easiest to bestow, O Guillotine!'</i>
</b><br /><br />After eighteen years as a political prisoner in the Bastille, the ageing Doctor Manette is finally released and reunited with his daughter in England. There the lives of two very different men, Charles Darnay, an exiled French aristocrat, and Sydney Carton, a disreputable but brilliant English lawyer, become enmeshed through their love for Lucie Manette. From the tranquil roads of London, they are drawn against their will to the vengeful, bloodstained streets of Paris at the height of the Reign of Terror, and they soon fall under the lethal shadow of La Guillotine.<br /><br />This edition uses the text as it appeared in its serial publication in 1859 to convey the full scope of Dickens's vision, and includes the original illustrations by H. K. Browne ('Phiz'). Richard Maxwell's introduction discusses the intricate interweaving of epic drama with personal tragedy.<br />--back cover",3.83,5:256688|4:242775|3:167835|2:60238|1:31414|total:758950,706286,11932,489,Penguin Books,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1344922523l/1953._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1344922523l/1953._SY75_.jpg,0141439602,9780141439600,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1953.A_Tale_of_Two_Cities

He was born in the parish of St. Andrews, in Holborn, a neighbourhood of London. After spending many years as a travelling actor, he performed for the theatre in Covent Garden. Stevens was most famous in his lifetime for his Lecture on Heads, a satirical alecturea on heads and fashion, with some addition by Mr. Pilon; which parodied the popularity of physiognomy. The lecture was first performed in 1764, and became an immediate success; he went on to perform it on tour throughout Great Britain, in Ireland, and in the American colonies at Boston and Philadelphia. He was also known as a popular songwriter, especially known for his bawdy drinking-songs and patriotic songs such as Liberty-Hall and The Briton. Many of both kinds were collected in his Songs, Comic and Satyrical (1788). Stevens also authored several dramatic pieces for the stage, a novel entitled Tom Fool, and a satire, The Birthday of Folly.",0.00,5:0|4:0|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:0,0,0,84,Dodo Press,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1409945529,9781409945529,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8762739-a-lecture-on-heads

Meanwhile Elinor, always sensitive to social convention, is struggling to conceal her own romantic disappointment, even from those closest to her. Through their parallel experience of love—and its threatened loss—the sisters learn that sense must mix with sensibility if they are to find personal happiness in a society where status and money govern the rules of love.<br /><br />This edition includes explanatory notes, textual variants between the first and second editions, and Tony Tanner's introduction to the original Penguin Classic edition.",4.07,5:358041|4:308670|3:158825|2:38717|1:20807|total:885060,831309,9981,409,Penguin Books,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1397245675l/14935._SY160_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1397245675l/14935._SY75_.jpg,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14935.Sense_and_Sensibility

Set on the obligatory English moor, on an isolated causeway, the story has as its hero Arthur Kipps, an up-and-coming young solicitor who has come north from London to attend the funeral and settle the affairs of Mrs. Alice Drablow of Eel Marsh House. The routine formalities he anticipates give way to a tumble of events and secrets more sinister and terrifying than any nightmare: the rocking chair in the deserted nursery, the eerie sound of a pony and trap, a child's scream in the fog, and most dreadfully--and for Kipps most tragically--<i>The Woman In Black</i>.<br /><br /><i>The Woman In Black</i> is both a brilliant exercise in atmosphere and controlled horror and a delicious spine-tingler--proof positive that this neglected genre, the ghost story, isn't dead after all.",3.71,5:10002|4:15651|3:12616|2:3669|1:878|total:42816,30411,2986,138,David R.

21864,35770545,"Journeys Through Bookland, Vol. 6",Charles Herbert Sylvester,"Excerpt HORATIUS By Lord Macaulay Note.-This spirited poem by Lord Macaulay is founded on one of the most popular Roman legends. While the story is based on facts, we can by no means be certain that all of the details are historical. According to Roman legendary history, the Tarquins, Lucius Tarquinius Priscus and Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, were among the early kings of Rome. The reign of the former was glorious, but that of the latter was most unjust and tyrannical. Finally the unscrupulousness of the king and his son reached such a point that it became unendurable to the people, who in 509 B. C. rose in rebellion and drove the entire family from Rome. Tarquinius Superbus appealed to Lars Porsena, the powerful king of Clusium for aid and the story of the expedition against Rome is told in this poem. Lars Porsena of ClusiumBy the Nine Gods he sworeThat the great house of TarquinShould suffer wrong no more.By the Nine Gods he swore it, And named a trysting day, And bade his messengers ride forthEast and west and south and north, To summon his array. East and west and south and northThe messengers ride fast, And tower and town and cottageHave heard the trumpet's blast.Shame on the false EtruscanWho lingers in his home, When Porsena of ClusiumIs on the march for Rome. The horsemen and the footmenAre pouring in amainFrom many a stately market-place;From many a fruitful plain.From many a lonely hamlet, Which, hid by beech and pine, Like an eagle's nest, hangs on the crestOf purple Apennine; * * * * * * * * There be thirty chosen prophets, The wisest of the land, Who alway by Lars PorsenaBoth morn and evening stand: Evening and morn the ThirtyHave turned the verses o'er, Traced from the right on linen whiteBy mighty seers of yore. And with one voice the ThirtyHave their glad answer given: ""Go forth, go forth, Lars Porsena;Go forth, beloved of Heaven: Go, and return in gloryTo Clusium's royal dome;And hang round Nurscia's altarsThe golden shields of Rome."" And now hath every citySent up her tale of men: The foot are fourscore thousand, The horse are thousand ten.Before the gates of SutriumIs met the great array.A proud man was Lars PorsenaUpon the trysting day. For all the Etruscan armiesWere ranged beneath his eye, And many a banished Roman, And many a stout ally;And with a mighty followingTo join the muster cameThe Tusculan Mamilius, Prince of the Latian name. But by the yellow TiberWas tumult and affright: From all the spacious champaignTo Rome men took their flight.A mile around the city, The throng stopped up the ways;A fearful sight it was to seeThrough two long nights and days. For aged folks on crutches, And women great with child, And mothers sobbing over babesThat clung to them and smiled, And sick men borne in littersHigh on the necks of slaves, And troops of sunburnt husbandmenWith reaping-hooks and staves, And droves of mules and assesLaden with skins of wine, And endless flocks of goats and sheep, And endless herds of kine, And endless trains of wagonsThat creaked beneath the weightOf corn-sacks and of household goods, Choked every roaring gate. Now, from the rock TarpeianCould the wan burghers spyThe line of blazing villagesRed in the midnight sky.The Fathers of the City, They sat all night and day, For every hour some horseman cameWith tidings of dismay. To eastward and to westwardHave spread the Tuscan bands;Nor house nor fence nor dovecoteIn Crustumerium stands.Verbenna down to OstiaHath wasted all the plain;Astur hath stormed Janiculum, And the stout guards are slain. Iwis, in all the Senate, There was no heart so bold, But sore it ached, and fast it beat, When that ill news was told.Forthwith up rose the Consul, Uprose the Fathers all;In haste they girded up their gowns, And hied them to the",0.00,5:0|4:0|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:0,0,0,,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1548196223,9781548196226,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35770545-journeys-through-bookland-vol-6
21865,6122317,The Legends of King Arthur and His Knights,James Knowles,"King Arthur is a legendary British leader who, according to Medieval histories and romances, led the defense of Britain against Saxon invaders in the early sixth century. The details of Arthur's story are mainly composed of folklore and literary invention, and his historical existence is debated and disputed by modern historians. The sparse historical background of Arthur is gleaned from various sources, including the Annales Cambriae, the Historia Brittonum, and the writings of Gildas. Arthur's name also occurs in early poetic sources such as Y Gododdin. The legendary Arthur developed as a figure of international interest largely through the popularity of Geoffrey of Monmouth's fanciful and imaginative 12th-century Historia Regum Britanniae (History of the Kings of Britain). However, some Welsh and Breton tales and poems relating the story of Arthur date from earlier than this work; in these works, Arthur appears either as a great warrior defending Britain from human and supernatural enemies or as a magical figure of folklore, sometimes associated with the Welsh Otherworld, Annwn. How much of Geoffrey's Historia (completed in 1138) was adapted from such earlier sources, rather than invented by Geoffrey himself, is unknown. Although the themes, events and characters of the Arthurian legend varied widely from text to text, and there is no one canonical version, Geoffrey's version of events often served as the starting point for later stories. Geoffrey depicted Arthur as a king of Britain who defeated the Saxons and established an empire over Britain, Ireland, Iceland, Norway and Gaul. In fact, many elements and incidents that are now an integral part of the Arthurian story appear in Geoffrey's Historia, including Arthur's father Uther Pendragon, the wizard Merlin, the sword Excalibur, Arthur's birth at Tintagel, his final battle against Mordred at Camlann and final rest in Avalon. The 12th-century French writer Chretien de Troyes, who added Lancelot and the Holy Grail to the story, began the genre of Arthurian romance that became a significant strand of medieval literature. In these French stories, the narrative focus often shifts from King Arthur himself to other characters, such as various Knights of the Round Table. Arthurian literature thrived during the Middle Ages but waned in the centuries that followed until it experienced a major resurgence in the 19th century. In the 21st century, the legend lives on, not only in literature but also in adaptations for theatre, film, television, comics and other media. The Sir James Knowles version of King Arthur is considered as the most accurate and well known original story of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table.",3.88,5:3221|4:2944|3:2275|2:659|1:242|total:9341,6342,70,217,Public Domain Books,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328109827l/6122317._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328109827l/6122317._SX50_.jpg,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6122317-the-legends-of-king-arthur-and-his-knights

But then, plans have a way of going out the window when a girl's parents skip town, leaving behind a half-million-dollar debt.<br /><br />She needs the job, so she puts up with her boss's diva antics and halfheartedly fends off the advances of the impossibly sexy stepson who comes with the high-paying gig. Then someone decides to kill the miserable movie star. It's bad news for any chef when a client dies from an allergic reaction after eating your cooking. It's even worse news for Rosemary because the police are determined to charge her with murder.<br /><br />To restore her reputation (and stay out of prison), Rosemary has to find the real murderer--and fast. Her short list of suspects includes a womanizing race car driver, a powerful music producer, Hollywood's hottest leading man, and, oh yeah, Felix, the dead woman's stepson--which gets a little awkward when he and Rosemary start dating.<br /><br />After a romantic dinner with Felix ends in food poisoning, she finds herself unattached, unemployed, and once again on the wrong side of the LAPD. She knows how to salvage an oversalted sauce, but can she salvage the disaster that is her life? And will the hunky homicide detective help her--or book her?<br /><br />If you love <i>Rosemary's Gravy</i>, be sure to check out <i>Sage of Innocence</i> and <i>Thyme to Live!</i>",3.83,5:912|4:1162|3:825|2:211|1:73|total:3183,230,16,269,Brown Street Books,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1553897773l/44657641._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1553897773l/44657641._SY75_.jpg,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44657641-rosemary-s-gravy

Dennis-Benn,"When Patsy gets her long-coveted visa to America, it comes after years of yearning to leave Pennyfield, the beautiful but impoverished Jamaican town where she was raised. More than anything, Patsy wishes to be reunited with her oldest friend, Cicely, whose letters arrive from New York steeped in the promise of a happier life and the possible rekindling of their young love. But Patsy’s plans don’t include her overzealous, evangelical mother―or even her five-year-old daughter, Tru.<br /><br />Beating with the pulse of a long-witheld confession, <i>Patsy</i> gives voice to a woman who looks to America for the opportunity to choose herself first―not to give a better life to her family back home. Patsy leaves Tru behind in a defiant act of self-preservation, hoping for a new start where she can be, and love, whomever she wants. But when Patsy arrives in Brooklyn, America is not as Cicely’s treasured letters described; to survive as an undocumented immigrant, she is forced to work as a bathroom attendant and nanny. Meanwhile, Tru builds a faltering relationship with her father back in Jamaica, grappling with her own questions of identity and sexuality, and trying desperately to empathize with her mother’s decision.<br /><br />Expertly evoking the jittery streets of New York and the languid rhythms of Jamaica, <i>Patsy</i> weaves between the lives of Patsy and Tru in vignettes spanning more than a decade as mother and daughter ultimately find a way back to one another.",3.86,5:643|4:1095|3:626|2:128|1:41|total:2533,1984,368,419,Liveright,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1542598016l/41817523._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1542598016l/41817523._SY75_.jpg,1631495631,9781631495632,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41817523-patsy
21894,6645659,"The Rover Boys at Colby Hall; or, The Struggles of the Young Cadets",Arthur M. Winfield,"Edward Stratemeyer (1862-1930) was born in Elizabeth, New Jersey. He was an American publisher and writer of books for children. He wrote 150 books himself, and created the most famous of the series books for juveniles, including the Rover Boys (1899 and after), Bobbsey Twins (1904), Tom Swift (1910), Hardy Boys (1927), and Nancy Drew (1930) series, among others. Stratemeyer pioneered the technique of producing long-running, consistent series of books using a team of freelance authors to write standardised novels, which were published under a pen name owned by his company. Through his Stratemeyer Syndicate, founded in 1906, Stratemeyer produced short plot summaries for the novels in each series, which he sent to other writers who completed the story. Stratemeyer's series were also innovative in that they were intended purely as entertainment, with little of the moral lessons or educational intent found in most other popular fiction of the early twentieth century. Stratemeyer's series included, besides the famous ones, many that are now forgotten except by collectors: The Motor Boys (1906), Honey Bunch (1923), The Blythe Girls (1925) and Bomba the Jungle Boy (1926).",4.00,5:12|4:5|3:10|2:1|1:0|total:28,12,2,248,Dodo Press,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1406521396,9781406521399,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6645659-the-rover-boys-at-colby-hall-or-the-struggles-of-the-young-cadets

21932,200620,An Embarrassment of Mangoes: A Caribbean Interlude,Ann Vanderhoof,"<i>An Embarrassment of Mangoes</i> is a delicious chronicle of leaving the type-A lifestyle behind -- and discovering the seductive secrets of life in the Caribbean.<br /><br />Who hasn’t fantasized about chucking the job, saying goodbye to the rat race, and escaping to some exotic destination in search of sun, sand, and a different way of life? Canadians Ann Vanderhoof and her husband, Steve did just that.<br /><br />In the mid 1990s, they were driven, forty-something professionals who were desperate for a break from their deadline-dominated, career-defined lives. So they quit their jobs, rented out their house, moved onto a 42-foot sailboat called Receta (“recipe,” in Spanish), and set sail for the Caribbean on a two-year voyage of culinary and cultural discovery.<br /><br />In lavish detail that will have you packing your swimsuit and dashing for the airport, Vanderhoof describes the sun-drenched landscapes, enchanting characters and mouthwatering tastes that season their new lifestyle. Come along for the ride and be seduced by Caribbean rhythms as she and Steve sip rum with their island neighbors, hike lush rain forests, pull their supper out of the sea, and adapt to life on “island time.”<br /><br />Exchanging business clothes for bare feet, they drop anchor in 16 countries -- 47 individual islands -- where they explore secluded beaches and shop lively local markets. Along the way, Ann records the delectable dishes they encounter -- from cracked conch in the Bahamas to curried lobster in Grenada, from Dominican papaya salsa to classic West Indian rum punch -- and incorporates these enticing recipes into the text so that readers can participate in the adventure.<br /><br />Almost as good as making the journey itself, <i>An Embarrassment of Mangoes</i> is an intimate account that conjures all the irresistible beauty and bounty from the Bahamas to Trinidad -- and just may compel you to make a rash decision that will land you in paradise.<br /><br /><i>Source is Amazon</i>",3.92,5:1449|4:1762|3:1103|2:255|1:73|total:4642,4115,360,320,Broadway Books,eng,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,0767914279,9780767914277,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/200620.An_Embarrassment_of_Mangoes

21969,23268862,Outcry - Holocaust memoirs,Manny Steinberg,"Outcry - Holocaust Memoirs, a Profoundly Moving Autobiography<br /><br />Mendel (Manny) Steinberg spent his teens in Nazi extermination camps in Germany and Poland, miraculously surviving while millions perished. This is his story.<br /><br />Born in 1925 in the Jewish ghetto in Radom (Poland), Manny soon realized that people of Jewish faith were increasingly being regarded as outsiders. In September 1939 the Nazis invaded, and the nightmare started. The city’s Jewish population had no chance of escaping and was faced with starvation, torture, sexual abuse and ultimately deportation.<br /><br />Outcry is the candid and moving account of a teenager who survived four Nazi camps: Dachau, Auschwitz, Vaihingen and Neckagerach. While being subjected to torture and degradation, he agonized over two haunting questions: ""Why the Jews?"" and ""How can the world let this happen?"" These questions remain hard to answer.<br /><br />Manny’s brother Stanley had jumped off the cattle wagon on the way to the extermination camp where his mother and younger brother were to perish. Desperately lonely and hungry, Stanley stood outside the compound hoping to catch a glimpse of Manny and their father. Once he discovered that they were among the prisoners, he turned himself in. The days were marked by hunger, cold, hard labor, and fear. Knowing that other members of the family were in the same camp kept them alive. Since acknowledging each other would have meant death, they pretended to be complete strangers.<br /><br />Manny relates how he was served human flesh and was forced to shave the heads of female corpses and pull out their teeth. Cherishing a picture of his beloved mother in his wooden shoe, he miraculously survived the terror of the Polish and German concentration camps together with his father and brother.<br /><br />When the Americans arrived in April 1945, Manny was little more than a living skeleton, with several broken ribs and suffering from a serious lung condition, wearing only a dirty, ragged blanket.<br /><br />This autobiography was written to fulfil a promise Manny made to himself during the first days of freedom. By publishing his Holocaust memoirs, he wants to ensure that the world never forgets what happened during WWII. The narrative is personal, unencumbered and direct.<br /><br />Outcry touches the reader with its directness and simplicity. The story is told through the eyes of an old man forcing himself to relive years of intense suffering. It is an account of human cruelty, but also a testimony to the power of love and hope. Memoirs worthy of being adapted for the big screen.<br /><br />""I read this book with a very heavy heart and tears running down my face. For Manny's endurance and his brother Stanley to be so tested is truly a testament to life! Bad people can do all the harm you want, but if one never gives up, the enemy will never win. Manny and his brother along with others, won. This is proven in this Holocaust book. A book well worth reading and learning from now and for future generations. It proves 'We will survive' ... Very well written as it goes straight to the reader's heart! The pictures are a treat, past, present and future, with a lovely tribute to his beloved, Mimi. Thank you for sharing 'YOU' with the rest of the world, Mr Steinberg! Bless you always.""<br /><br />""Manny Steinberg shares his extraordinary teenage story of surviving four concentration camps in an account noteworthy for its straightforward, unencumbered narrative. His is a story almost everyone can imagine happening to themselves - no less harrowing than more dramatic renditions of Holocaust survival, but somehow more compelling, and universal, for the unembellished simplicity of his style.""<br /><br />""You must read Outcry. You will have tears and joy how this young boy survived the six years in concentration camps in Poland and Germany. It is a hand-made story for a motion picture.

21970,1201864,The Scarlet Plague,Jack London,"'An old man, James Howard Smith, walks along deserted railway tracks, long since unused and overgrown; beside him a young, feral boy helps him along. It has been 60 years since the great Red Death wiped out mankind, and the handful of survivors from all walks of life have established their own civilization and their own hierarchy in a savage world. Art, science, and all learning has been lost, and the young descendants of the healthy know nothing of the world that was—nothing but myths and make-believe. The old man is the only one who can convey the wonders of that bygone age, and the horrors of the plague that brought about its end. What future lies in store for the remnants of mankind can only be surmised—their ignorance, barbarity, and ruthlessness the only hopes they have?'",3.60,5:717|4:1462|3:1371|2:343|1:79|total:3972,2255,208,98,,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1292626937l/1201864.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1292626937l/1201864._SY75_.jpg,1556560370,9781556560378,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1201864.The_Scarlet_Plague
21971,1201818,A Son of the Sun: The Adventures of Captain David Grief,Jack London,"Entertaining, atmospheric, and action-filled--yet difficult to obtain until now--the eight short stories in Jack London’s A Son of the Sun center on the thrilling exploits of Captain David Grief in the dangerous and exotic South Seas.<br /><br />Captain Grief encounters the adventurers, scoundrels, pirates, and opportunists who followed the example of their colonial predecessors and exploited the islands and their resources early in the twentieth century. Inspired by London’s own voyage through the South Seas on board his self-made yacht, the Snark, these stories paint a colorful--and at times horrifying--picture of the remote South Pacific.<br /><br />Thomas R. Tietze and Gary J. Riedl provide concise and illuminating introductions to each story as well as informative notes. The volume is enlivened by reproductions of London’s own photographs and maps, and by the illustrations that accompanied each story when first published.",3.62,5:40|4:55|3:42|2:16|1:9|total:162,96,7,288,University of Oklahoma Press,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328814533l/1201818._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328814533l/1201818._SY75_.jpg,0806133627,9780806133621,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1201818.A_Son_of_the_Sun
21972,6462,His Excellency: George Washington,Joseph J. Ellis,"To this landmark biography of our first president, Joseph J. Ellis brings the exacting scholarship, shrewd analysis, and lyric prose that have made him one of the premier historians of the Revolutionary era. Training his lens on a figure who sometimes seems as remote as his effigy on Mount Rushmore, Ellis assesses George Washington as a military and political leader and a man whose “statue-like solidity” concealed volcanic energies and emotions.<br /><br />Here is the impetuous young officer whose miraculous survival in combat half-convinced him that he could not be killed. Here is the free-spending landowner whose debts to English merchants instilled him with a prickly resentment of imperial power. We see the general who lost more battles than he won and the reluctant president who tried to float above the partisan feuding of his cabinet. <b>His Excellency</b> is a magnificent work, indispensable to an understanding not only of its subject but also of the nation he brought into being.",3.92,5:11263|4:12661|3:6309|2:1572|1:1503|total:33308,32279,1090,320,Vintage,eng,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1400032539,9781400032532,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6462.His_Excellency

Il ragazzo vorrebbe vedere un raro disco di vinile, pensa di restare qualche minuto e andare via. Non uscirà più. Con una folle progressione geometrica, un passo dopo l’altro, Sonia fa in modo che Jez non lasci la casa sul fiume, fino a quando non scoprirà di esserne prigioniero, di non poter chiedere aiuto. La sola possibilità che gli restaè trovare un modo per convivere con lei, con quella donna che lo considera una cosa sua, un oggetto da proteggere, da custodire. Non ha altra strada se non venire a patti con la sua carceriera: del resto, chi lo cercherebbe mai in quella splendida, vecchia dimora in riva al Tamigi? Chi sospetterebbe di unamoglie e madre esemplare, che non ha mai mostrato alcun segno di squilibrio? La casa sul fiume è la storia di un’ossessione, di uno smarrimento che affonda le sue radici nei meandri più oscuri della psiche. Ed è la storia di una donna reale e vera come solo il dolore sa esserlo: perché la sua solitudine, i suoi ricordi, i suoi moventi parlano al cuore di ognuno di noi.",3.40,5:291|4:608|3:639|2:235|1:106|total:1879,827,153,352,Plume,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1336672494l/13506596.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1336672494l/13506596._SY75_.jpg,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13506596-kept-in-the-dark

22004,4953,A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius,Dave Eggers,"'When you read his extraordinary memoir you don't laugh, then cry, then laugh again; you somehow experience these emotions all at once.'<br /><br />""Well, this was when Bill was sighing a lot. He had decided that after our parents died he just didn't want any more fighting between what was left of us. He was twenty-four, Beth was twenty-three, I was twenty-one, Toph was eight, and all of us were so tried already, from that winter. So when something would come up, any little thing, some bill to pay or decision to make, he would just sigh, his eyes tired, his mouth in a sorry kind of smile. <br /><br />But Beth and I...Jesus, we were fighting with everyone, anyone, each other, with strangers at bars, anywhere -- we were angry people wanting to exact revenge. We came to California and we wanted everything, would take what was ours, anything within reach. And I decided that little Toph and I, he with his backward hat and long hair, living together in our little house in Berkeley, would be world-destroyers. We inherited each other and, we felt, a responsibility to reinvent everything, to scoff and re-create and drive fast while singing loudly and pounding the windows. It was a hopeless sort of exhilaration, a kind of arrogance born of fatalism, I guess, of the feeling that if you could lose a couple of parents in a month, then basically anything could happen, at any time -- all bullets bear your name, all cars are there to crush you, any balcony could give way; more disaster seemed only logical. <br /><br />And then, as in Dorothy's dream, all these people I grew up with were there, too, some of them orphans also, most but not all of us believing that what we had been given was extraordinary, that it was time to tear or break down, ruin, remake, take and devour. This was San Francisco, you know, and everyone had some dumb idea -- I mean, wicca? -- and no one there would tell you yours was doomed. Thus the public nudity, and this ridiculous magazine, and the Real World tryout, all this need, most of it disguised by sneering, but all driven by a hyper-awareness of this window, I guess, a few years when your muscles are taut, coiled up and vibrating. But what to do with the energy? I mean, when we drive, Toph and I, and we drive past people, standing on top of all these hills, part of me wants to stop the car and turn up the radio and have us all dance in formation, and part of me wants to run them all over.""",3.68,5:44776|4:53627|3:37631|2:16494|1:8404|total:160932,155687,8408,485,Vintage,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327714834l/4953._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327714834l/4953._SY75_.jpg,0375725784,9780375725784,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4953.A_Heartbreaking_Work_of_Staggering_Genius

For the first time, accounts of these openings have been brought together in a single volume, providing a unique history of the saint from his death to the present day.<br /><br />Including details of his death and burial, the moment when monks first discovered his remains to be incorrupt, and the most recent exhumation of his relics in 1899, David Willem brings alive the mystery and intrigue of the life of Cuthbert's corpse, and tries to answer questions such as, ""When did the corpse decay?"" and, ""Is Cuthbert still buried in Durham Cathedral?""<br /><br /><em>""Elegant, accessible, and movingly written.""</em><br /><br />- <strong>Giles E.

Cambiare l'indomani con il domani non era cosa difficile, se a quel primo vocabolo, sortomi spontaneamente nel cervello col concetto stesso dell'opera, io non ci avessi tenuto con una specie di simpatia superstiziosa; oltre che mi sembra piu snello, piu vivo, piu efficace, piu preciso.""",0.00,5:0|4:0|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:0,0,0,96,Createspace,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1385990466l/18840604._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1385990466l/18840604._SX50_.jpg,1493695665,9781493695669,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18840604-l-indomani

22050,164531,The Railway Children,E. Nesbit,"In this much-loved children's classic first published in 1906, the comfortable lives of three well-mannered siblings are greatly altered when, one evening, two men arrive at the house and take their father away.

22053,47105204,Stories of King Arthur and His Knights Retold from Malory's Morte dArthur,U Waldo Cutler,"King Arthur was a legendary British leader who, according to medieval histories and romances, led the defence of Britain against Saxon invaders in the late 5th and early 6th centuries. The details of Arthur's story are mainly composed of folklore and literary invention, and his historical existence is debated and disputed by modern historians. The sparse historical background of Arthur is gleaned from various sources, including the Annales Cambriae, the Historia Brittonum, and the writings of Gildas. Arthur's name also occurs in early poetic sources such as Y Gododdin.Arthur is a central figure in the legends making up the Matter of Britain. The legendary Arthur developed as a figure of international interest largely through the popularity of Geoffrey of Monmouth's fanciful and imaginative 12th-century Historia Regum Britanniae (History of the Kings of Britain). In some Welsh and Breton tales and poems that date from before this work, Arthur appears either as a great warrior defending Britain from human and supernatural enemies or as a magical figure of folklore, sometimes associated with the Welsh otherworld Annwn. How much of Geoffrey's Historia (completed in 1138) was adapted from such earlier sources, rather than invented by Geoffrey himself, is unknown.",0.00,5:0|4:0|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:0,0,0,210,Independently Published,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1099063612,9781099063619,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/47105204-stories-of-king-arthur-and-his-knights-retold-from-malory-s-morte-darthu

  <em>One word can change a life.</em>
</p><p>Sarah Sharpe has grown up as a carpenter’s daughter, knowing only the rough and work-heavy world of her father’s blue-collar profession. Abandoned by her mother as a baby, she’s lived twenty-one years content to drive nails at her dad’s side. Following her father into the world of construction was a natural path, and she took it without a second thought. But a harsh comment about her “butch” appearance sends her on a search for identity. <br />Enter handsome and easygoing Jesse Chapman, the roofer she meets on her first foray into volunteer work for Homes For Hope. In every way, the quirky man is her opposite—confident, a people kind of guy, and most importantly, happy. His likable qualities continue to draw her in, and for some reason he keeps coming back to her. But they can’t be more than friends—he’s made that crystal clear. Except for a handful of times…and the confusion is driving her crazy.<br />Sarah’s quest for self-definition becomes more tangled than she ever imagined, and she discovers that the journey will take her deeper than clothes and makeup. Filling the void in her heart becomes an obsession she cannot escape. How far is she willing to go to discover who she really is?</p>",4.48,5:167|4:57|3:32|2:4|1:1|total:261,222,47,,,eng,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29745688-the-carpenter-s-daughter

22066,1156922,The Long Roll,Mary    Johnston,"""The two rode on. To left and right were lighted streets of tents, visited here and there by substantial cabins. Soldiers were everywhere, dimly seen within the tents where the door-flap was fastened back, about the camp-fires in open places, clustering like bees in the small squares, everywhere apparent in the foreground and divined in the distance. From somewhere came the strains of 'Yankee Doodle.' A gust of wind blew out the folds of the stars and stripes, fastened above some regimental headquarters. The city of tents and of frame structures hasty and crude, of fires in open places, of Butlers' shops and canteens and booths of strolling players, of chapels and hospitals, of fluttering flags and wandering music, of restless blue soldiers, oscillating like motes in some searchlight of the giants, persisted for a long distance. At last it died away; there came a quiet field or two, then the old Maryland town of Frederick.""from <i>The Long Roll </i><br /><br />Before <i>Gone with the Wind</i> exploded into print, Mary Johnston's <i>The Long Roll </i>was one of the definitive novels about the Civil War. Unlike Mitchell's novel of Southern aristocracy, however, Johnston sets her tale among the fighting armies. <i>The Long Roll</i> begins with secession and ends with the funeral of Stonewall Jackson. Our protagonists are Richard Cleave of Virginia, and General Jackson himself, who begins the novel as a major. Cleaves' action in the Confederate artillery alternates with Jackson's cavalry maneuvers to show a wide range of battle experience and combat effectiveness. Johnston peels away some of the historical romance of the cavalry and shows how vital artillery was in the battles. No less significant, she pays close attention to the importance of planning and patience, and the role of roads, rail, horse, and boat, mixing all of these elements with descriptions of raw courage and reckless abandon. As the narrative follows Cleave and Jackson, we are led through the most decisive engagements in the years of Confederate supremacy: Manassas, The Seven Days, Fredericksburg, Malvern Hill, and Sharpsburg. <i>The Long Roll </i>brings alive the differing motives for secession and war, and eerily evokes the suspicion and battered consciences of both North and South.",3.84,5:23|4:17|3:15|2:6|1:2|total:63,32,4,668,Johns Hopkins University Press,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,0801855241,9780801855245,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1156922.The_Long_Roll

He is one of the fathers of the modern short story. As a protege of Flaubert, his short stories are characterized by their economy of style and their efficient effortless denouement. In 1880 he published his first masterpiece, Boule de Suif, which Flaubert characterized as ""a masterpiece that will endure. "" This was Maupassant's first piece of short fiction and was followed by short stories such as Deux Amis (1882) and Mademoiselle Fifi (1882). He also wrote six short novels. A number of his stories often denote the futility of war and the innocent civilians who, caught, emerge changed - many are set during the Franco-Prussian War of the 1870s. In his novels, he concentrated all his observations scattered in his short stories. His second novel was Bel-Ami; or, The History of a Scoundrel, which came out in 1885. His other works include: La Maison Tellier (1881), Une Vie (1883), Miss Harriet (1884), Mont-Oriol (1887), Pierre et Jean (1888), Fort Comme la Mort (1889) and Notre Coeur (1890).",4.67,5:2|4:1|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:3,2,0,,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12837347-the-works-of-guy-de-maupassant-volume-viii

Then Taylor’s dad gets devastating news, and her parents decide that the family will spend one last summer all together at their old lake house in the Pocono Mountains.<br /><br />Crammed into a place much smaller and more rustic than they are used to, they begin to get to know each other again. And Taylor discovers that the people she thought she had left behind haven’t actually gone anywhere. Her former best friend is still around, as is her first boyfriend…and he’s much cuter at seventeen than he was at twelve.<br /><br />As the summer progresses and the Edwards become more of a family, they’re more aware than ever that they’re battling a ticking clock.

22088,43958,Apologia Pro Vita Sua (A Defense of One's Life),John Henry Newman,"A highly influential figure in the Church of England, John Henry Newman stunned the Anglican community in 1843, when he left his position as vicar of St. Mary's, Oxford, to join the Roman Catholic church. Perhaps no one took greater offense than Protestant clergyman Charles Kingsley, whose scathing attacks against Newman's faith and honor inspired this brilliant response. <i>Apologia Pro Vita Sua,</i> Newman's spiritual autobiography, explores the depths and nature of Christianity with flowing prose and a conversational style that has ensured its status as a classic.<br />""False ideas may be refuted by argument, but by true ideas alone are they expelled. I will vanquish,"" Newman promised, ""not my accuser, but my judges."" His honest and passionate defense consists of a personal history of his religious convictions, from earliest memory through the Oxford movement and his ultimate conversion. His concluding point-by-point refutation of Kingsley's charges features thought-provoking contentions that strike at the very roots of the principles underlying Protestantism. Newman won respect and admiration with his <i>Apologia,</i> a work that has helped clarify perceptions of Roman Catholicism among readers of every faith.",4.12,5:528|4:338|3:207|2:59|1:21|total:1153,869,49,336,Dover Publications,eng,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,0486442136,9780486442136,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43958.Apologia_Pro_Vita_Sua

His father was a sea captain, and in 1875 he left London on his father's ship for Australia, and soon after his arrival in Sydney obtained a position as a master at a private school. He returned to England in April 1879 and decided to take up the study of sex. He studied medicine at St Thomas' Hospital, although he never had a regular medical practice; he joined The Fellowship of the New Life in 1883, meeting other social reformers Edward Carpenter and George Bernard Shaw. In November, 1891 at the age of 32, he married the English writer and proponent of women's rights, Edith Lees. Their ""open marriage"" was the central subject in Ellis's autobiography, My Life. His book Sexual Inversion (1897), was the first English medical text book on homosexuality, co-authored with John Addington Symonds. Other psychologically important concepts developed by Ellis include autoerotism and narcissism. He was a supporter of eugenics which he wrote about in The Task of Social Hygiene (1912).",4.25,5:3|4:0|3:0|2:1|1:0|total:4,3,0,,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19115458-the-task-of-social-hygiene

22101,19410630,Wood Folk at School,William Joseph Long,"It may surprise many, whose knowledge of wild animals is gained from rare, fleeting glimpses of frightened hoof or wing in the woods, to consider that there can be such a thing as a school for the Wood Folk; or that instruction has any place in the life of the wild things. Nevertheless it is probably true that education among the higher order of animals has its distinct place and value. Their knowledge, however simple, is still the result of three factors: instinct, training, and experience. Instinct only begins the work; the mother's training develops and supplements the instinct; and contact with the world, with its sudden dangers and unknown forces, finishes the process. For many years the writer has been watching animals and recording his observations with the idea of determining, if possible, which of these three is the governing factor in the animal's life. Some of the results of this study were published last year in a book called ""School of the Woods,"" which consisted of certain studies of animals from life, and certain theories in the form of essays to account for what the writer's eyes had seen and his own ears heard in the great wilderness among the animals. A school reader is no place for theories; therefore that part of the book is not given here. The animal studies alone are reproduced in answer to the requests from many teachers that these be added to the Wood Folk books. From these the reader can form his own conclusions as to the relative importance of instinct and training, if he will. But there is another and a better way open: watch the purple martins for a few days when the young birds first leave the house; find a crow's nest, and watch secretly while the old birds are teaching their little ones to fly; follow a fox, or any other wild mother-animal, patiently as she leaves the den and leads the cubs out into the world of unknown sights and sounds and smells, -and you will learn more in a week of what education means to the animals than anybody's theories can ever teach you. These are largely studies of individual animals and birds. They do not attempt to give the habits of a class or species, for the animals of the same class are alike only in a general way; they differ in interest and intelligence quite as widely as men and women of the same class, if you but watch them closely enough. The names here given are those of the Milicete Indians, as nearly as I can remember them; and the incidents have all passed under my own-eyes and were recorded in the woods, from my tent or canoe, just as I saw them.",4.20,5:1|4:4|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:5,4,0,,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19410630-wood-folk-at-school

When she lands a lucrative three-book deal with an eminent publisher, she thinks her problems are all over. However, Gwen's need to be near her sick mother means she’s unable to travel to London to work with her devilishly desirable editor, John Thatcher, and he must come and stay with her in Wales. Handsome and eminently capable, cosmopolitan John is used to getting his own way and has plans for the future which certainly don’t include being distracted by pretty Welsh girls; nevertheless when he journeys into the country to work with Gwen it’s not long before he finds himself falling in love with her, as well as the house she’s so anxious to save. But is John capable of loving anyone as much as his job?

22104,19767413,The Acorn-Planter: A California Forest Play,Jack London,"In the morning of the world, while his tribe makes its camp for the night in a grove, Red Cloud, the first man of men, and the first man of the Nishinam, save in war, sings of the duty of life, which duty is to make life more abundant. The Shaman, or medicine man, sings of foreboding and prophecy. The War Chief, who commands in war, sings that war is the only way to life. This Red Cloud denies, affirming that the way of life is the way of the acorn- planter, and that whoso slays one man slays the planter of many acorns. Red Cloud wins the Shaman and the people to his contention. After the passage of thousands of years, again in the grove appear the Nishinam. In Red Cloud, the War Chief, the Shaman, and the Dew-Woman are repeated the eternal figures of the philosopher, the soldier, the priest, and the woman—types ever realizing themselves afresh in the social adventures of man. Red Cloud recognizes the wrecked explorers as planters and life-makers, and is for treating them with kindness. But the War Chief and the idea of war are dominant The Shaman joins with the war party, and is privy to the massacre of the explorers. A hundred years pass, when, on their seasonal migration, the Nishinam camp for the night in the grove. They still live, and the war formula for life seems vindicated, despite the imminence of the superior life-makers, the whites, who are flooding into California from north, south, east, and west—the English, the Americans, the Spaniards, and the Russians. The massacre by the white men follows, and Red Cloud, dying, recognizes the white men as brOther acorn-planters, the possessors of the superior life-formula of which he had always been a protagonist. In the Epilogue, or Apotheosis, occur the celebration of the death of war and the triumph of the acorn-planters.",2.50,5:1|4:1|3:2|2:1|1:3|total:8,0,0,,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19767413-the-acorn-planter

22121,18254,Oliver Twist,Charles Dickens,"A gripping portrayal of London's dark criminal underbelly, published in Penguin Classics with an introduction by Philip Horne.<br /><br />The story of Oliver Twist - orphaned, and set upon by evil and adversity from his first breath - shocked readers when it was published. After running away from the workhouse and pompous beadle Mr Bumble, Oliver finds himself lured into a den of thieves peopled by vivid and memorable characters - the Artful Dodger, vicious burglar Bill Sikes, his dog Bull's Eye, and prostitute Nancy, all watched over by cunning master-thief Fagin. Combining elements of Gothic Romance, the Newgate Novel and popular melodrama, Dickens created an entirely new kind of fiction, scathing in its indictment of a cruel society, and pervaded by an unforgettable sense of threat and mystery.<br /><br />This Penguin Classics edition of Oliver Twist is the first critical edition to faithfully reproduce the text as its earliest readers would have encountered it from its serialisation in Bentley's Miscellany, and includes an introduction by Philip Horne, a glossary of Victorian thieves' slang, a chronology of Dickens's life, a map of contemporary London and all of George Cruikshank's original illustrations.<br /><br />For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

22132,57586,Giants in the Earth,O.E. Rølvaag,"<i>Giants in the Earth</i> (Norwegian: <i>Verdens Grøde</i>) is a novel by Norwegian-American author Ole Edvart Rølvaag. First published in Norwegian as two books in 1924 and 1925, the English edition was translated by the author and Lincoln Colcord, each of whom also wrote prefatory matter.<br /><br />Part of a trilogy, the novel follows a Norwegian pioneer family's struggles with the land and the elements of the Dakota Territory as they try to make a new life in America. The book is based partly on Rølvaag's personal experiences as a settler, and on the experiences of his wife’s family who had been immigrant homesteaders. The novel depicts snow storms, locusts, poverty, hunger, loneliness, homesickness, the difficulty of fitting into a new culture, and the estrangement of immigrant children who grow up in a new land.<br /><br /><i>Giants in the Earth</i> was turned into an opera by Douglas Moore and Arnold Sundgaard; it won the Pulitzer Prize for Music in 1951.",4.00,5:1766|4:1743|3:914|2:254|1:115|total:4792,4483,431,531,Harper Perennial Modern Classics,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1401111215l/57586._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1401111215l/57586._SY75_.jpg,0060931930,9780060931933,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57586.Giants_in_the_Earth

22135,997346,The Moral Economy of the Peasant: Rebellion and Subsistence in Southeast Asia,James C. Scott,"James C. Scott places the critical problem of the peasant household—subsistence—at the center of this study. The fear of food shortages, he argues persuasively, explains many otherwise puzzling technical, social, and moral arrangements in peasant society, such as resistance to innovation, the desire to own land even at some cost in terms of income, relationships with other people, and relationships with institutions, including the state.<br /><br />Once the centrality of the subsistence problem is recognized, its effects on notions of economic and political justice can also be seen. Scott draws from the history of agrarian society in lower Burma and Vietnam to show how the transformations of the colonial era systematically violated the peasants’ “moral economy” and created a situation of potential rebellion and revolution.<br /><br />Demonstrating keen insights into the behavior of people in other cultures and a rare ability to generalize soundly from case studies, Scott offers a different perspective on peasant behavior that will be of interest particularly to political scientists, anthropologists, sociologists, and Southeast Asianists.<br /><br />“The book is extraordinarily original and valuable and will have a very broad appeal. I think the central thesis is correct and compelling.”—Clifford Geertz<br /><br /> “In this major work, … Scott views peasants as political and moral actors defending their values as well as their individual security, making his book vital to an understanding of peasant politics.”—Library Journal",3.94,5:89|4:98|3:55|2:10|1:10|total:262,212,12,254,Yale University Press,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,0300021909,9780300021905,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/997346.The_Moral_Economy_of_the_Peasant

22149,14332370,"The Journal of Negro History, Volume 6, (1921)",Carter G. Woodson,"The Journal of Negro History was founded on January 1, 1916 as a quarterly research journal. It was published by the Association for the Study of African American Life and History founded in 1915 by Carter G. Woodson and Jesse E. Moorland. In 2002, The Journal of Negro History became The Journal of African American History. Carter Godwin Woodson (1875-1950) was born in New Canton, Virginia. He was an African American historian, author, journalist and the founder of Black History Month. He is considered the first to conduct a scholarly effort to popularize the value of Black History. Woodson recognized and acted upon the importance of a people having an awareness and knowledge of their contributions to humanity and left behind an impressive legacy. He was a member of the first black fraternity Sigma Pi Phi and a member of Omega Psi Phi as well. In 1915, Woodson and Jesse E. Moorland co-founded the Association for the Study of African American Life and History. By this time convinced that the role of his own people in American history and in the history of other cultures was being either ignored or misrepresented among scholars, Woodson realized the need for special research into the neglected past of the Negro. In the same year appeared one of his most scholarly books, The Education of the Negro Prior to 1861 (1915). He also was the author of A Century of Negro Migration (1918).",5.00,5:1|4:0|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:1,0,0,536,Dodo Press,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1406573973,9781406573978,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14332370-the-journal-of-negro-history-volume-6

22155,6392337,The Expressman And The Detective (Pinkerton #6),Allan Pinkerton,"Allan Pinkerton (1819 -1884) was a Scottish detective known for creating the Pinkerton National Detective Agency, the first detective agency of the United States. Pinkerton first used ""shadowing"" (surveillance of a suspect) and ""assuming a role"" (undercover work). The detective stories he wrote were based in part on his own experiences and those of his agents. This first detective story is set in 19th century Alabama. An excerpt reads, ""The officers of the company were completely at a loss. It was discovered beyond a doubt that the package had been sent from Atlanta. The messenger who received it bore an excellent character, and the company could not believe him guilty of the theft. The lock of the pouch was examined and found in perfect order, so that it evidently had not been tampered with. The messenger was positive that he had not left the safe open when he went out of the car, and there was no sign of the lock's having been forced.""",3.43,5:10|4:20|3:28|2:7|1:2|total:67,32,8,,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6392337-the-expressman-and-the-detective

22158,6433428,The Lure of the Mask,Harold MacGrath,"1908. With illustrations by Harrison Fisher and Carl Anderson. MacGrath, a prolific writer, wrote for newspapers until 1890 when he published his first novel Arms and the Woman. The Lure of the Mask begins: Out of the unromantic night, out of the somber blurring January fog, came a voice lifted in song, a soprano, rich, full and round, young yet matured, sweet and mysterious as a night-bird's, haunting and elusive as the murmur of the sea in a shell: a lilt from La Fille de Madame Ango, a light opera long since forgotten in New York. Hillard, genuinely astonished, lowered his pipe and listened. To sit dreaming by an open window, even in this unlovely first month of the year, in that grim unhandsome city which boasts of its riches and still accepts with smug content its rows upon rows of ugly architecture, to sit dreaming, then, of red-tiled roofs, of cloud-caressed hills, of terraced vineyards, of cypresses in their dark aloofness, is not out of the natural order of things; but that into this idle and pleasant dream there should enter so divine a voice, living, feeling, pulsing, this was not ordinary at all.

Our aim is to provide readers with the highest quality reproductions of fiction and non-fiction literature that has stood the test of time. The many thousands of books in our collection have been sourced from libraries and private collections around the world.The titles that Trieste Publishing has chosen to be part of the collection have been scanned to simulate the original. Our readers see the books the same way that their first readers did decades or a hundred or more years ago. Books from that period are often spoiled by imperfections that did not exist in the original. Imperfections could be in the form of blurred text, photographs, or missing pages. It is highly unlikely that this would occur with one of our books. Our extensive quality control ensures that the readers of Trieste Publishing's books will be delighted with their purchase. Our staff has thoroughly reviewed every page of all the books in the collection, repairing, or if necessary, rejecting titles that are not of the highest quality. This process ensures that the reader of one of Trieste Publishing's titles receives a volume that faithfully reproduces the original, and to the maximum degree possible, gives them the experience of owning the original work.We pride ourselves on not only creating a pathway to an extensive reservoir of books of the finest quality, but also providing value to every one of our readers.

22186,6730855,For the Liberty of Texas,Edward Stratemeyer,"Edward Stratemeyer (1862-1930) was born in Elizabeth, New Jersey. He was an American publisher and writer of books for children. He wrote 150 books himself, and created the most famous of the series books for juveniles, including the Rover Boys (1899 and after), Bobbsey Twins (1904), Tom Swift (1910), Hardy Boys (1927), and Nancy Drew (1930) series, among others. Stratemeyer pioneered the technique of producing long-running, consistent series of books using a team of freelance authors to write standardised novels, which were published under a pen name owned by his company. Through his Stratemeyer Syndicate, founded in 1906, Stratemeyer produced short plot summaries for the novels in each series, which he sent to other writers who completed the story. Stratemeyer's series were also innovative in that they were intended purely as entertainment, with little of the moral lessons or educational intent found in most other popular fiction of the early twentieth century. Stratemeyer's series included, besides the famous ones, many that are now forgotten except by collectors: The Motor Boys (1906), Honey Bunch (1923), The Blythe Girls (1925) and Bomba the Jungle Boy (1926).",4.00,5:2|4:1|3:2|2:0|1:0|total:5,2,1,240,Dodo Press,eng,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1406521345,9781406521344,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6730855-for-the-liberty-of-texas

Ruskin believed that if she would devote herself to art ""she would be the greatest living painter and do things that would be immortal. "" - he was unhappy that she was spending so much time on the streets of London, helping with the YWCA when he thought she ought to be painting. Lilias, however, decided to give up her career in art in order to serve God. She always remained a good friend of Ruskin's though, and they wrote many letters when she was in Algeria. She also wrote several books - beautifully illustrated by herself, including: Parables of the Cross (1894), Parables of the Christ-Life (1899), and a book for Sufi Muslims The Way of the Sevenfold Secret.",4.56,5:86|4:20|3:14|2:2|1:0|total:122,69,14,48,Dodo Press,eng,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,140990721X,9781409907213,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5746479-parables-of-the-cross

To talk of self and not be offensive demands an art which is not always given to man. And yet we are always longing to get near each other and to understand each other We are delighted to publish this classic book as part of our extensive Classic Library collection. Many of the books in our collection have been out of print for decades, and therefore have not been accessible to the general public. The aim of our publishing program is to facilitate rapid access to this vast reservoir of literature, and our view is that this is a significant literary work, which deserves to be brought back into print after many decades. The contents of the vast majority of titles in the Classic Library have been scanned from the original works. To ensure a high quality product, each title has been meticulously hand curated by our staff. Our philosophy has been guided by a desire to provide the reader with a book that is as close as possible to ownership of the original work. We hope that you will enjoy this wonderful classic work, and that for you it becomes an enriching experience.",2.00,5:0|4:0|3:0|2:1|1:0|total:1,0,0,36,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1721846492,9781721846498,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45703534-the-making-of-a-novelist-an-experiment-in-autobiography

22214,7201740,Molly Bawn,The Duchess,"Margaret Wolfe Hungerford, nee Hamilton, (1855-1897), was an Irish novelist whose light romantic fiction was popular in England and America in the late 19th century. As a child she enjoyed making up stories, and won prizes for her writing at school. She was educated at Portarlington College. She wrote her first novel Phyliss (1877) when she was 18 years old. Soon after its favourable reception, she wrote Molly Bawn (1878), which became her most well-known book. She was one of the few women in Victorian times who was both a prolific author and mother of a sizeable family. She approached her writing methodically, setting aside three hours every morning for it. The room where she did her writing had neatly organized manuscripts at her desk, surrounded by many reference works, novels, and other books. Her books were first published anonymously, and later as by ""Mrs. Hungerford."" In the United States, her books were mostly published under the pen name ""The Duchess.""

In fact, fate has been a downright bitch. <br /><br />Isabelle has learned the hard way how hard life can be when fate isn’t by your side. It can hand you dreams on silver platters, but it can snatch them right back and hand you nightmares. One thing Isabelle knew for sure fate was consistent with was taking away everything she ever loved.<br /><br />For the last two years Isabelle has been slowly clearing the clouds of her past. Happiness is finally on the horizon. She has a thriving business, great friends, and her life back. All she has to do is jump over the last hurdle…her ex-husband. <br /><br />When problems start causing her to fear her new life, and memories that are better left forgotten start rushing to the surface the last thing she needs is a ghost from her past to come knocking on her door. <br /><br />Axel never thought he would look into the eyes of Isabelle West again, and he wasn’t sure he wanted to now. He’s carried his anger for so long he isn’t sure he can just turn it off, but when he is faced with protecting her and an unexpected desire to have her again, life gets a little more complicated. <br /><br />How will Axel and Isabelle deal when all their cards are put on the table and everything they thought was true blows up in their faces? <br /><br /><br /><b>

He went on to write about his travelling adventures, including The Tent Dwellers, written about a trout fishing trip to Nova Scotia. His 1901 book The Great White Way written about the Arctic indirectly gave New York City's Broadway the name ""Great White Way"" He was the official biographer and literary executor for Mark Twain, and worked with him (and on his behalf after his death) on various projects.

22269,1577133,Autobiography of Madame Guyon,Jeanne Marie Bouvier de la Motte Guyon,"Madame Guyon was a French noblewoman who was born in an unprincipled time fated to its corruption. She grew up in a church as licentious as the world in which it was established: spiritually despondent and plagued by ignorance. Regardless of these tormenting conditions, she rose to the inimitability of Christian veneration. She had an unsteady and disorganized childhood, was tormented by sickness and abuse, and was imprisoned for years by the highest church authorities. She gave up her worldly goods at the demands of this church which led to her impoverishment. She survived her psychological and physical ruination by conquering pretentious royal conspiracies and reviling the malignancy of the papal inquisition. She committed her life to writing meditative books that illustrated profound truths lost to religious monarchs in a maze of their own confusion. She was finally condemned as a heretic, but her writings were so dynamic they shocked the whole country and even reached the indecorous palace of King Louis XIV. This is the story of a solitary woman whose pious diligence and dedication laid the bedrock of virtous obedience to the deeds of contemporaneous ministry.",4.02,5:86|4:55|3:40|2:9|1:8|total:198,89,9,212,NuVision Publications,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1595479260,9781595479266,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1577133.Autobiography_of_Madame_Guyon

22275,20959913,VC - A Chronicle of Castle Barfield and of the Crimea,David Christie Murray,"The people of Castle Barfield boast that the middle of their High Street is on a level with the cross of St. Paul's Cathedral. The whole country-side is open, and affords a welcome to storm from whatever corner of the compass it may blow. You have to get right away into the Peak district before you can find anything like an eminence of distinction, though the mild slopes of Quarry-moor and Cline, a few miles to the westward, save the prospect from complete monotony. East, and a trifle to the north, rises Beacon Hargate, on the top whereof one of the innumerable bonfires which warned England of the coming of the Armada hung out its flaming banner in the sight of three counties. Topping that high tableland, Beacon Hargate is familiar with wild weather at the proper seasons, and by dint of use takes very little notice of it. But on the evening on which this story has its proper beginning such a storm raged round and over the old Beacon as no man or woman of that region could even remember. It began in the grey of the dawn in wild and fitful gusts, driving thick squalls of rain before them, but long before midday it lost its first waywardness and settled down to business with a steady purpose. It grew in force from hour to hour, and almost from minute to minute, until all living things sought shelter. The disconsolate cattle huddled under the sparse hedgerows, looking down their broad, dripping noses in a meek abandonment to fate. The sheep packed themselves in any hollowed corner they could find, and hugged their soaked fleeces close to each other in uncomplaining patience. The trees fought the blast with impotent arms, and shrieked and groaned their protest against it Flying boughs, like great grotesque birds, went hurtling through the air.",0.00,5:0|4:0|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:0,0,0,,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20959913-vc---a-chronicle-of-castle-barfield-and-of-the-crimea

22286,15997,Paradise Lost,John Milton,"John Milton's <i>Paradise Lost</i> is one of the greatest epic poems in the English language. It tells the story of the Fall of Man, a tale of immense drama and excitement, of rebellion and treachery, of innocence pitted against corruption, in which God and Satan fight a bitter battle for control of mankind's destiny. The struggle rages across three worlds - heaven, hell, and earth - as Satan and his band of rebel angels plot their revenge against God. At the center of the conflict are Adam and Eve, who are motivated by all too human temptations but whose ultimate downfall is unyielding love.<br /><br />Marked by Milton's characteristic erudition, Paradise Lost is a work epic both in scale and, notoriously, in ambition. For nearly 350 years, it has held generation upon generation of audiences in rapt attention, and its profound influence can be seen in almost every corner of Western culture.",3.81,5:39759|4:37773|3:28452|2:10186|1:4574|total:120744,110265,2497,453,Penguin Classics,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1526070678l/15997._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1526070678l/15997._SY75_.jpg,0140424393,9780140424393,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15997.Paradise_Lost

But they do try to communicate, with a short-order cook in a small desert town serving as their reluctant confidant. Odd Thomas thinks of himself as an ordinary guy, if possessed of a certain measure of talent at the Pico Mundo Grill and rapturously in love with the most beautiful girl in the world, Stormy Llewellyn.<br /><br />Maybe he has a gift, maybe it's a curse, Odd has never been sure, but he tries to do his best by the silent souls who seek him out. Sometimes they want justice, and Odd's otherworldly tips to Pico Mundo's sympathetic police chief, Wyatt Porter, can solve a crime. Occasionally they can prevent one. But this time it's different.<br /><br />A mysterious man comes to town with a voracious appetite, a filing cabinet stuffed with information on the world's worst killers, and a pack of hyena-like shades following him wherever he goes. Who the man is and what he wants, not even Odd's deceased informants can tell him. His most ominous clue is a page ripped from a day-by-day calendar for August 15.<br /><br />Today is August 14.<br /><br />In less than twenty-four hours, Pico Mundo will awaken to a day of catastrophe. As evil coils under the searing desert sun, Odd travels through the shifting prisms of his world, struggling to avert a looming cataclysm with the aid of his soul mate and an unlikely community of allies that includes the King of Rock 'n' Roll. His account of two shattering days when past and present, fate and destiny converge is the stuff of our worst nightmares, and a testament by which to live: sanely if not safely, with courage, humor, and a full heart that even in the darkness must persevere.",3.96,5:94636|4:72880|3:42592|2:13578|1:11205|total:234891,224751,6190,446,Bantam,eng,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,0553384287,9780553384284,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14995.Odd_Thomas

22297,775477,The Coasts of Bohemia: A Czech History,Derek Sayer,"In <i>The Winter's Tale</i>, Shakespeare gave the landlocked country of Bohemia a coastline--a famous and, to Czechs, typical example of foreigners' ignorance of the Czech homeland. Although the lands that were once the Kingdom of Bohemia lie at the heart of Europe, Czechs are usually encountered only in the margins of other people's stories. In <i>The Coasts of Bohemia</i>, Derek Sayer reverses this perspective. He presents a comprehensive and long-needed history of the Czech people that is also a remarkably original history of modern Europe, told from its uneasy center.<br /><br /><br /> Sayer shows that Bohemia has long been a theater of European conflict. It has been a cradle of Protestantism and a bulwark of the Counter-Reformation; an Austrian imperial province and a proudly Slavic national state; the most easterly democracy in Europe; and a westerly outlier of the Soviet bloc. The complexities of its location have given rise to profound (and often profoundly comic) reflections on the modern condition. Franz Kafka, Jaroslav Hasek, Karel Capek and Milan Kundera are all products of its spirit of place. Sayer describes how Bohemia's ambiguities and contradictions are those of Europe itself, and he considers the ironies of viewing Europe, the West, and modernity from the vantage point of a country that has been too often ignored.<br /><br /><br /><br /><i>The Coasts of Bohemia</i> draws on an enormous array of literary, musical, visual, and documentary sources ranging from banknotes to statues, museum displays to school textbooks, funeral orations to operatic stage-sets, murals in subway stations to censors' indexes of banned books. It brings us into intimate contact with the ever changing details of daily life--the street names and facades of buildings, the heroes figured on postage stamps--that have created and recreated a sense of what it is to be Czech. Sayer's sustained concern with questions of identity, memory, and power place the book at the heart of contemporary intellectual debate. It is an extraordinary story, beautifully told.",3.65,5:13|4:32|3:23|2:5|1:2|total:75,64,10,464,Princeton University Press,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,069105052X,9780691050522,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/775477.The_Coasts_of_Bohemia

In addition to writing philosophical works, Edman was a frequent contributor to literary magazines such as The New Yorker, the Atlantic Monthly, the New York Times Magazine, Harper's, and Commentary. The Introduction begins, ""This book was written, originally and primarily, for use in a course entitled ""Introduction to Contemporary Civilization,"" required of all Freshmen in Columbia College. It is an attempt to give a bird's-eye view of the processes of human nature, from man's simple inborn impulses and needs to the most complete fulfillment of these in the deliberate activities of religion, art, science, and morals. It is hoped that the book may give to the student and general reader a knowledge of the fundamentals of human nature and a sense of the possibilities and limits these give to human enterprise.""",3.40,5:0|4:2|3:3|2:0|1:0|total:5,5,0,,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19307781-human-traits-and-their-social-significance

22317,8213749,George Bowring: A Tale of Cader Idris,R.D. Blackmore,"Richard Doddridge Blackmore (1825-1900), referred to most commonly as R. D. Blackmore, was one of the most famous English novelists of his generation. Over the course of his career, Blackmore achieved a close following around the world. He won literary merit and acclaim for his vivid descriptions and personification of the countryside, sharing with Thomas Hardy a Western England background and a strong sense of regional setting in his works. Noted for his eye for and sympathy with nature, critics of the time described this as one of the most striking features of his writings. He acted as pioneer of the new Romantic Movement in fiction. His magnum opus Lorna Doone (1869) enjoyed considerable popularity since it was published. Blackmore's reputation rests chiefly upon this romantic work, in spite of the fact that it was not his favourite. His works also include Mary Anerley (1880) and Slain by the Doones (1895).",3.67,5:0|4:2|3:1|2:0|1:0|total:3,2,0,52,Dodo Press,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1406595926,9781406595925,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8213749-george-bowring

22329,286299,A Daughter of the Middle Border,Hamlin Garland,"This sequel to Garland’s acclaimed autobiography, <i>A Son of the Middle Border, </i>continues his story as he sets out for Chicago and settles into a Bohemian encampment of artists and writers. There he meets Zulime Taft, an artist who captures his heart and eventually becomes his wife. The intensity of this romance is rivaled only by Garland’s struggle between America’s coastal elite and his heartland roots. <i>A Daughter of the Middle Border</i> won the Pulitzer Prize in 1922, forever securing his place in the literary canon.<br /><br />Excerpt:<br />In the summer of 1893, after nine years of hard but happy literary life in Boston and New York, I decided to surrender my residence in the East and reestablish my home in the West, a decision which seemed to be - as it was - a most important event in my career. <br />This change of headquarters was due not to a diminishing love for New England, but to a deepening desire to be near my aging parents, whom I had persuaded, after much argument, to join in the purchase of a family homestead, in West Salem, Wisconsin, the little village from which we had all adventured some thirty years before. <br />My father, a typical pioneer, who had grown gray in opening new farms, one after another on the wind-swept prairies of Iowa and Dakota, was not entirely content with my plan but my mother, enfeebled by the hardships of a farmer's life, and grateful for my care, was glad of the arrangement I had brought about.

22332,2538457,Brain Twister,Mark  Phillips,"""Mark Phillips"" was the pseudonym of two well-known science fiction writers: Randall Garrett and Laurence M. Janifer. Their joint pen-name, derived from their middle names (Philip and Mark), was coined soon after their original meeting, at a science-fiction convention. Both men were drunk at the time, which explains a good deal, and only one ever sobered up. A matter for constant contention between the collaborators was which one. They collaborated for some years, and devised an interesting method of work: Mr. Garrett handled the verbs, the adverbs and the interjections, Mr. Janifer the nouns, pronouns, and adjectives. Conjunctions are a matter of joint decision, and in the case of a tie, the entire game was replayed at Fenway Park, Boston, the following year. Regardless of who wrote what, Brain Twister is a highly enjoyable novel about spies and telepathy, as only two great writers could have conceived it!",3.44,5:35|4:66|3:72|2:30|1:7|total:210,110,10,128,Wildside Press,eng,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1434401561,9781434401564,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2538457.Brain_Twister

22338,1168341,Physics of the Impossible,Michio Kaku,"A fascinating exploration of the science of the impossible—from death rays and force fields to invisibility cloaks—revealing to what extent such technologies might be achievable decades or millennia into the future.<br /><br />One hundred years ago, scientists would have said that lasers, televisions, and the atomic bomb were beyond the realm of physical possibility. In Physics of the Impossible, the renowned physicist Michio Kaku explores to what extent the technologies and devices of science fiction that are deemed equally impossible today might well become commonplace in the future.<br /><br />From teleportation to telekinesis, Kaku uses the world of science fiction to explore the fundamentals—and the limits—of the laws of physics as we know them today. He ranks the impossible technologies by categories—Class I, II, and III, depending on when they might be achieved, within the next century, millennia, or perhaps never. In a compelling and thought-provoking narrative, he explains:<br />· How the science of optics and electromagnetism may one day enable us to bend light around an object, like a stream flowing around a boulder, making the object invisible to observers “downstream”<br />· How ramjet rockets, laser sails, antimatter engines, and nanorockets may one day take us to the nearby stars<br />· How telepathy and psychokinesis, once considered pseudoscience, may one day be possible using advances in MRI, computers, superconductivity, and nanotechnology<br />· Why a time machine is apparently consistent with the known laws of quantum physics, although it would take an unbelievably advanced civilization to actually build one<br />Kaku uses his discussion of each technology as a jumping-off point to explain the science behind it. An extraordinary scientific adventure, Physics of the Impossible takes readers on an unforgettable, mesmerizing journey into the world of science that both enlightens and entertains.",4.08,5:12105|4:10719|3:5063|2:1213|1:737|total:29837,26692,916,329,Doubleday Books,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320469147l/1168341._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320469147l/1168341._SY75_.jpg,0385520697,9780385520690,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1168341.Physics_of_the_Impossible

The volume, which he now offers to the public attention, is intended as a sequel to these Inquiries; and his object in it is to investigate, in the same unpretending manner, the Moral Feelings of the Human Mind, and the principles which ought to regulate our volitions and our conduct as moral and responsible beings. The two branches of investigation are, in many respects, closely connected; and, on this'account, it may often happen, that, in the present work, principles are assumed as admitted or proved, which, in the former, were stated at length, with the evidence by which they are supported.<br /><br />About the Publisher<br /><br />Forgotten Books publishes hundreds of thousands of rare and classic books.

22397,41396467,Shakespearean Playhouses a History of English Theatres from the Beginnings to the Restoration: Large Print,Joseph Quincy Adams,"Shakespearean Playhouses A History of English Theatres from the Beginnings to the Restoration by Joseph Quincy Adams BEFORE the building of regular playhouses the itinerant troupes of actors were accustomed, except when received into private homes, to give their performances in any place that chance provided, such as open street-squares, barns, town-halls, moot-courts, schoolhouses, churches, and-most frequently of all, perhaps-the yards of inns. These yards, especially those of carriers' inns, were admirably suited to dramatic representations, consisting as they did of a large open court surrounded by two or more galleries. Many examples of such inn-yards are still to be seen in various parts of England; a of the famous White Hart, in Southwark, is given opposite page by way of illustration. In the yard a temporary platform-a few boards, it may be, set on barrel-heads-could be erected for a stage; in the adjacent stables a dressing-room could be provided for the actors; the rabble-always the larger and more enthusiastic part of the audience-could be accommodated with standing-room about the stage; while the more aristocratic members of the audience could be comfortably seated in the galleries overhead. Thus a ready-made and very serviceable theatre was always at the command of the players; and it seems to have been frequently made use of from the very beginning of professionalism in acting. We are delighted to publish this classic book as part of our extensive Classic Library collection. Many of the books in our collection have been out of print for decades, and therefore have not been accessible to the general public. The aim of our publishing program is to facilitate rapid access to this vast reservoir of literature, and our view is that this is a significant literary work, which deserves to be brought back into print after many decades. The contents of the vast majority of titles in the Classic Library have been scanned from the original works.

Our philosophy has been guided by a desire to provide the reader with a book that is as close as possible to ownership of the original work.

At times uplifting, at times harrowing, but in its entirety compelling and worthwhile reading, Fox's Book of Martyrs is a work of supreme Christian devotion. It catalogs the rise to prominence, and deaths, of many Christian saints and martyrs who placed their faith above all else. Many were, under penalty of torture and death, told to give up their beliefs: by refusing, they proved themselves to be of the highest devotion. When this book was published in 1563, the Christian church was in the throes of schism: the Reformation was proceeding at a fast pace, creating the first denominational forks in Christianity. The rise of Protestantism, and the attempts by the Catholic Church at preventing a split and consequent loss of authority, left a marked impression upon John Fox.",0.00,5:0|4:0|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:0,0,0,308,Lulu.com,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1387996851,9781387996858,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/47770239-fox-s-book-of-martyrs

He is considered the father of modern singing poetry, as he referred to it, in which verses are meant to be sung or chanted. His numerous correspondences with the poet Yeats detail his intentions to revive the musical qualities in poetry as had been practiced by the ancient Greeks.

22418,34323010,Dollars and Sense: How We Misthink Money and How to Spend Smarter,Dan Ariely,"<strong>Why is paying for things painful?</strong>
   
   
    <strong>Why are we comfortable overpaying for something in the present just because we’ve overpaid for it in the past?</strong>
   
   
    <strong>Why is it easy to pay $4 for a soda on vacation, when we wouldn’t spend more than $1 on that same soda at our local grocery store?</strong>
   
 <p>We think of money as numbers, values, and amounts, but when it comes down to it, when we actually use our money, we engage our hearts more than our heads. Emotions play a powerful role in shaping our financial behavior, often making us our own worst enemies as we try to save, access value, and spend responsibly. In <em>Dollars and Sense</em>, bestselling author and behavioral economist Dan Ariely teams up with financial comedian and writer Jeff Kreisler to challenge many of our most basic assumptions about the precarious relationship between our brains and our money. In doing so, they undermine many of personal finance’s most sacred beliefs and explain how we can override some of our own instincts to make better financial choices.</p><p>Exploring a wide range of everyday topics—from the lure of pain-free spending with credit cards to the  pitfalls of household budgeting to the seductive power of holiday sales—Ariely and Kreisler demonstrate how our misplaced confidence in our spending habits frequently leads us astray, costing us more than we realize, whether it’s the real value of the time we spend driving forty-five minutes to save $10 or our inability to properly assess what the things we buy are actually worth. Together Ariely and Kreisler reveal the emotional forces working against us and how we can counteract them. Mixing case studies and anecdotes with concrete advice and lessons, they cut through the unconscious fears and desires driving our worst financial instincts and teach us how to improve our money habits.</p><p>The result not only reveals the rationale behind our most head-scratching financial choices but also offers clear guidance for navigating the treacherous financial landscape of the brain. Fascinating, engaging, funny, and essential, <em>Dollars and Sense</em> provides the practical tools we need to understand and improve our financial choices, save and spend smarter, and ultimately live better.</p>",3.71,5:450|4:952|3:769|2:140|1:23|total:2334,1820,260,288,Harper,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1496059770l/34323010._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1496059770l/34323010._SY75_.jpg,0062651226,9780062651228,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34323010-dollars-and-sense

(Benjamin Orange) Flower It is a good thing that the Inquisition, Star-chamber, and other compulsory institutions of the dark past have departed from Europe, and have never been tolerated in America. Were it not so, at the present time there would be much excellent work for the rack, the thumbscrew, and the faggot. Heresy is in the air, especially in the northern latitudes of the United States. We inhale it with the morning breezes, it stimulates us to mental activity during the noon hour, and at times stifles us as by the sultry atmosphere of a blistering day. Everywhere it is being discussed, and by every kind of individual, qualified or unqualified for such high contentions. Daily journals, hitherto never remarkable for orthodoxy, have suddenly grown anxious as to the future of the faith; and other journals, that have always antagonized orthodoxy, are, figuratively speaking, rubbing their hands most gleefully and smiling through their editorial columns with a most perceptible ""I told you so""; while religious papers, representing as they do, the conservative element in this country, are apparently staggered at the inroads which the so-called higher criticism has made of late. Aged people ominously shake their heads, and striplings of the limp-back Bible type are amazed at the stir which ideas are making in the community, and which threaten to disturb the peace and quiet of their mediocre godliness; and pious women engaged on crazy quilts, in the interest of noble benefactions, stop with punctured and bleeding fingers to protest against all departures from ancient doctrinal symbols. We are delighted to publish this classic book as part of our extensive Classic Library collection. Many of the books in our collection have been out of print for decades, and therefore have not been accessible to the general public. The aim of our publishing program is to facilitate rapid access to this vast reservoir of literature, and our view is that this is a significant literary work, which deserves to be brought back into print after many decades. The contents of the vast majority of titles in the Classic Library have been scanned from the original works. To ensure a high quality product, each title has been meticulously hand curated by our staff. Our philosophy has been guided by a desire to provide the reader with a book that is as close as possible to ownership of the original work.

Ernst Heinrich Philipp August Haeckel (1834-1919), also written von Haeckel, was an eminent German biologist, naturalist, philosopher, physician, professor and artist who discovered, described and named thousands of new species, mapped a genealogical tree relating all life forms, and coined many terms in biology, including phylum, phylogeny, ecology and the kingdom Protista. Haeckel promoted and popularised Charles Darwin's work in Germany and developed the controversial recapitulation theory. Sir John Arthur Thomson (1861-1933) was a Scottish naturalist who authored several notable books and was an expert on soft corals. He taught at University of Aberdeen from 1899 until 1930, the year he was knighted. His popular works sought to reconcile science and religion. Thomson's Outline of Science, published in 1922, sold more than one hundred thousand copies in five years. Friedrich Leopold August Weismann (1834-1914) was a German biologist. He was ranked the second most notable evolutionary theorist of the 19th century, after Charles Darwin. He graduated as a medical doctor and settled in Frankfurt.

22468,62233,"The Elves of Cintra (Genesis of Shannara, #2)",Terry Brooks,"With his groundbreaking New York Times bestseller The Sword of Shannara and its acclaimed sequels, Terry Brooks brought a new audience to epic fantasy. Then he gave the genre a darkly compelling contemporary twist in his trilogy of the Word and the Void. Last year, in Armageddon’s Children, Brooks undertook the stunning chronicle that united two unique worlds. Now that story of clashing forces of darkness and light, of Shannara’s beginnings and the human race’s possible end, marches forward into an unforgettable second volume full of mystery, magic, and momentous events.<br /><br />Across the ruined landscape that is America–hopelessly poisoned, plague-ridden, burned, and besieged by demon armies bent on exterminating all mortal life–two pilgrims have been summoned to serve the embattled cause of good. Logan Tom has journeyed to desolate Seattle to protect a ragged band of street urchins and the being known as “the gypsy morph,” who is both mortal and magical, and destined to save mankind unless he is destroyed. Likewise, Angel Perez has her own quest, one that will take her from the wreckage of Los Angeles to a distant, secret place untouched by the horrors of the nationwide blight–a place where the race of Elves has dwelled since before man existed. But close behind these lone Knights of the Word swarm the ravening forces of the Void. <br /><br />As the menacing thunder of war drums heralds the arrival of the demons and their brutal minions in Seattle, the young survivors who call themselves the Ghosts are forced to brave the dangerous world of gangs, mutants, and worse to escape the invasion. And Logan Tom must infiltrate a refugee compound to rescue Hawk, the leader of the street urchins, who has yet to learn the truth about who and what he is. Meanwhile, Angel Perez has joined an equally urgent mission: to find the Ellcrys, a fabled talisman crucial to protecting the Elven realm against an influx of unspeakable evil from the dread dimension known as the Forbidding. But Angel and her Elf allies must beware–for a demon spy, with a monstrous creature at its command, walks among them.<br /><br />As the legions of darkness draw the noose tighter, and the time of confrontation draws near, those chosen to defend the soul of the world must draw their battle lines and prepare to fight with, and for, their lives. If they fail, humanity falls.",4.11,5:5120|4:5524|3:2599|2:401|1:90|total:13734,11966,314,379,Del Rey/Ballantine,eng,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,0345484118,9780345484116,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62233.The_Elves_of_Cintra

Through painstaking research and a witty, sarcastic style, Fort captures the imagination while exposing the flaws of popular scientific explanations. Virtually all of his material was compiled and documented from reports published in reputable journals, newspapers and periodicals because he was an avid collector. Charles Fort was somewhat of a recluse who spent most of his spare time researching these strange events and collected these reports from publications sent to him from around the globe. This was the first of a series of books he created on unusual and unexplained events and to this day it remains the most popular.

22475,7745326,"The Tower, The Zoo, and The Tortoise",Julia Stuart,"Brimming with charm and whimsy, this exquisite novel set in the Tower of London has the transportive qualities and delightful magic of the contemporary classics Chocolat and Amélie.<br /><br />Balthazar Jones has lived in the Tower of London with his loving wife, Hebe, and his 120-year-old pet tortoise for the past eight years. That’s right, he is a Beefeater (they really do live there). It’s no easy job living and working in the tourist attraction in present-day London. <br /><br />Among the eccentric characters who call the Tower’s maze of ancient buildings and spiral staircases home are the Tower’s Rack &amp; Ruin barmaid, Ruby Dore, who just found out she’s pregnant; portly Valerie Jennings, who is falling for ticket inspector Arthur Catnip; the lifelong bachelor Reverend Septimus Drew, who secretly pens a series of principled erot­ica; and the philandering Ravenmaster, aiming to avenge the death of one of his insufferable ravens. <br /><br />When Balthazar is tasked with setting up an elaborate menagerie within the Tower walls to house the many exotic animals gifted to the Queen, life at the Tower gets all the more interest­ing. Penguins escape, giraffes are stolen, and the Komodo dragon sends innocent people running for their lives. Balthazar is in charge and things are not exactly running smoothly. Then Hebe decides to leave him and his beloved tortoise “runs” away. <br /><br />Filled with the humor and heart that calls to mind the delight­ful novels of Alexander McCall Smith, and the charm and beauty of The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, <i>The Tower, the Zoo, and the Tortoise</i> is a magical, wholly origi­nal novel whose irresistible characters will stay with you long after you turn the stunning last page. <br /><br />Published in the UK in August 2010 as Balthazar Jones and the Tower of London Zoo.",3.58,5:1582|4:3390|3:2787|2:852|1:275|total:8886,7624,1505,304,Doubleday,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320449123l/7745326._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320449123l/7745326._SY75_.jpg,0385533284,9780385533287,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7745326-the-tower-the-zoo-and-the-tortoise

22480,247126,The Prussian Officer,D.H. Lawrence,"His first published collection, these twelve stories were written between 1907 and 1914, during a crucial period of development for Lawrence from which he emerged a leading figure of the modernist movement. Reaching new levels of feeling and experience, these stories range from the tale of a Prussian officer who drives his orderly towards a bloody reckoning, to the strangely exotic elements of ""A Fragment of Stained Glass"", and the divisions within society and conflicts of the heart that form the central themes of ""Daughters of a Vicar"". Interweaving individual lives, their happiness, failures and defeats, with the profound forces of nature, Lawrence has created stories of remarkable power and sensitivity. This Penguin edition reproduces the newly established Cambridge text, which is based on Lawrence's manuscripts, typescripts and corrected proofs.",3.55,5:64|4:114|3:117|2:31|1:12|total:338,208,14,224,Penguin,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1380097310l/247126._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1380097310l/247126._SY75_.jpg,0140005137,9780140005134,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/247126.The_Prussian_Officer

22482,11265849,Men in the Making,Bruce Machart,"From the critically acclaimed author of <i>The Wake of Forgiveness</i>—“a mesmerizing, mythic saga,” as described by the <i>New York Times</i>—come ten remarkable stories that uncover unexpected beauty in the struggles of the modern American male. <br /><br />Like Richard Russo, Bruce Machart has a profound knowledge of the male psyche and a gift for conveying the absurdity and brutality of daily life with humor and compassion. Whether they find themselves walking the fertile farmland of south Texas, steering trucks through the suffocating sprawl of Houston, or turning logs into paper in the mills just west of the Sabine River, the men of these stories seek to prove themselves in a world that doesn’t always welcome them. Here are men whose furrows are never quite straight and whose hearts are near to bursting with all the desires they have been told they aren’t supposed to heed. <br /><br />“<b>Bruce Machart is one of our most ambitious and fearless young writers</b>. With <i>Men in the Making</i>, he has composed a remarkable paean to the complex fragility of the American male. I read these stories in a state of tender amazement.”—Steve Almond, author of <i>Rock and Roll Will Save Your Life</i>",3.92,5:38|4:46|3:20|2:9|1:3|total:116,106,30,208,Houghton Mifflin Harcourt,en-US,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327927063l/11265849._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327927063l/11265849._SY75_.jpg,0156034441,9780156034449,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11265849-men-in-the-making

22488,40835147,"The Mirror of Taste, and Dramatic Censor Volume I, Number 1",S C (Stephen Cullen) Carpenter,"The Mirror of Taste, and Dramatic Censor Volume I, Number 1 S. C. (Stephen Cullen) Carpenter The advantages of a correct judgment and refined taste in all matters connected with literature, are much greater than men in general imagine. The hateful passions have no greater enemies than a delicate taste and a discerning judgment, which give the possessor an interest in the virtues and perfections of others, and prompt him to admire, to cherish, and make them known to the world. Criticism, the parent of these qualities, therefore, mends the heart, while it improves the understanding. The influence of critical knowledge is felt in every department of social life, as it supplies elegant subjects for conversation, and enlarges the scope, and extends the duration of intellectual enjoyment. Without it, the pleasures we derive from the fine arts would be transient and imperfect; and poetry, painting, music, and that admirable epitome of life, the stage, would afford nothing more than a fugitive, useless, pastime, if not aided by the interposition of the judgment, and sent home, by the delightful process of criticism, to the memory, there to exercise the mind to the last of life, to be the amusement of our declining years, and, when all the other faculties for receiving pleasure are impaired by old age and infirmity, to cast the sunshine of delight over the last moments of our existence. We are delighted to publish this classic book as part of our extensive Classic Library collection. Many of the books in our collection have been out of print for decades, and therefore have not been accessible to the general public. The aim of our publishing program is to facilitate rapid access to this vast reservoir of literature, and our view is that this is a significant literary work, which deserves to be brought back into print after many decades. The contents of the vast majority of titles in the Classic Library have been scanned from the original works. To ensure a high quality product, each title has been meticulously hand curated by our staff. Our philosophy has been guided by a desire to provide the reader with a book that is as close as possible to ownership of the original work.

22499,25194553,La crisi in giallo,Nicola Fantini,"Il «giallo» si adatta magnificamente alla crisi economica. E non solo perché i migliori polizieschi sono sempre in fondo indagini sulla disperazione sociale. Ma anche perché la crisi economica dà rilievo a quella malinconia morale che pervade ogni storia nera: che i veri criminali, a ben guardare, sono ben altri del comune delinquente. Inoltre, lo sfondo di deserti industriali, di miseri in lotta per la pagnotta, di ex ricchi piombati nella vergogna del bisogno, di gesti clamorosi di chi non ha niente da perdere, di profittatori del bisogno estremo, di speculatori che giocano al ribasso dei beni sociali, di fughe di capitali, di truffe per furbizia o per fame, aggiunge alla finzione noir una forte dose di verità e di solidarietà umana.<br />Tutto questo mescolarsi di denuncia sociale, di spietato realismo e di consapevole empatia è ciò che accomuna i sei racconti gialli che qui presentiamo. Scritti da autori i cui eroi hanno altrove dato prova della loro capacità di immergersi nel tessuto della società nei suoi risvolti più nascosti ed estremi.",3.28,5:5|4:23|3:27|2:10|1:2|total:67,64,12,290,Sellerio,ita,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1427030968l/25194553._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1427030968l/25194553._SX50_.jpg,8838933367,9788838933363,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25194553-la-crisi-in-giallo

Procedevano silenziosi, e fra quelle faccie vispe ed abbronzate avresti scorto il contrasto dei visi pallidi e smunti, il languore della persona e l'abbandono delle forze disegnavano su quelle fronti gelate dispetto e spavento! Pierio e Bizco avanzavano primi portando sulle braccia Emma e lor dappresso era l'uffiziale il quale sosteneva la baronessa, aiutato nel pio ufficio da Arrigo. Il capitano, gli altri passeggieri, l'equipaggio, seguivanli; e negli occhi vivaci di quei pietosi vallegiani brillava la gioia della buon'azione e il rammarico insieme della sgraziata avventura. Quella processione sarebbe sembrata un mortoro, se fossevi apparso un feretro! Raccolti nella piccola sala della Lanterna, molti fra gli accompagnatori s'allontanarono, e ad Emma, adagiata sul lettuccio, fur fatti aspirare sali ed essenze. A poco a poco la giovinetta rinvenne, e la madre die un grido di gioia allorche alla sua amata si sprigiono dal petto un sospiro.

22511,20362735,Rollo on the Rhine,Jacob Abbott,"Rollo on the Rhine By Jacob Abbott on the cathedral was suspended on account of the want of funds, the men left this crane on the top of the tower, because they hoped to be able to resume the work again before long. But years and generations passed, and the prospect did not mend; and at last the old crane, which in its lofty position was exposed to all the storms and tempests of the sky, of course began gradually to decay. It is true it was protected as much as possible by a sort of casing made around it, to shelter it from the weather; but notwithstanding this, in the course of several centuries it became so unsound that there began to be danger that it might fall. The authorities of the town, therefore, decided to take it down, intending to postpone putting up a new one until the work of finishing the cathedral should be resumed, if indeed it ever should be resumed. We are delighted to publish this classic book as part of our extensive Classic Library collection. Many of the books in our collection have been out of print for decades, and therefore have not been accessible to the general public.

22526,6328938,Cubs of the Wolf,Raymond F. Jones,"<em>from the introductory:</em><p>In the spring the cherry blossoms are heavy in the air over the campus of Solarian Institute of Science and Humanities. On a small slope that rims the park area, Cameron Wilder lay on his back squinting through the cloud of pink-white petals to the sky beyond. Beside him, Joyce Farquhar drew her jacket closer with an irritated gesture. It was still too cold to be sitting on the grass, but Cameron didn't seem to notice it-or anything else, Joyce thought.<br /><br />""If you don't submit a subject for your thesis now,"" she said, ""you'll take another full six months getting your doctorate. Sometimes I think you don't really want it!""<br /><br />Cameron stirred. He shifted his squinting gaze from the sky to Joyce and finally sat up. But he was staring ahead through the trees again as he took his pipe from his pocket and began filling it slowly.<br /><br />""I <i>don't</i> want it if it's not going to mean anything after I get it,"" he said belligerently. ""I'm not going to do an investigation of some silly subject like The Transience of Venusian Immigrants in Relation to the Martian Polar Ice Cap Cycle. Solarian sociologists are the butt of enough ridicule now. Do something like that and for the rest of your life you get knocking of the knees whenever anybody inquires about the speciality you worked in and threatens to read your thesis.""<br /><br />""Nobody's asking you to do anything you don't want to. But <i>you</i> picked the field of sociology to work in. Now I don't see why you have to act such a purist that it takes months to find a research project for your degree. Pick something -- anything! -- I don't care what it is. But if you don't get a degree and an appointment out of the next session I don't think we'll ever get married -- not ever.""<br /><br />Cameron removed his pipe from his mouth with a precise grip and considered it intently as it cupped in his hands. ""I'm glad you mentioned marriage,"" he said. ""I was just about to speak of it myself.""<br /><br />""Well, don't!"" said Joyce. ""After three years -- Three years!""<br /><br />He turned to face her and smiled for the first time. He liked to lead her along occasionally just to watch her explode, but he was not always sure when he had gone too far.

Admirateur des romantiques, il s'en détache pour professer la recherche du beau à travers une perfection technique, selon la théorie de l'art pour l'art des parnassiens. <br /> <br />Né à Tarbes en 1811, entre au collège Charlemagne à Paris en 1820 et fait la connaissance du futur poète Gérard de Nerval. Sa rencontre, en 1829, avec Victor Hugo le bouleverse et il participe à la bataille d'Hernani en 1830. Le jeune Théophile publie son premier recueil de poésie en 1830, qui n'a aucun succès. En 1833, il écrit à la demande d'un éditeur un recueil de nouvelles, ""Les Jeunes-France"", dans lequel il décrit de façon cocasse le milieu des artistes romantiques. Il récidive avec le roman ""Mademoiselle de Maupin"", en 1835, et prend définitivement ses distances avec les romantiques. En 1836, il commence à écrire pour le journal ""La Chronique de Paris"", à la demande d'Honoré de Balzac, et y publie ses premières nouvelles fantastiques : ""La Mort amoureuse"" (1836) et ""La Chaîne d'or"" (1837). D'autres nouvelles et contes fantastiques suivront : ""Le Pied de momie"" (1840), ""Arria Marcella"" (1852) ou encore ""Spirite"" (1865). <br />Il se fait également connaître en tant que critique d'art, domaine où il excelle. Il écrit des pièces de théâtre et même un opéra, ""Giselle"" (1841), qui est un grand succès. Il publie un recueil de poèmes, ""Émaux et camées"" en 1852, qui lui apporte la reconnaissance de ses pairs. Baudelaire lui dédie son recueil ""Les Fleurs du mal"" en 1857. Théophile Gautier aime aussi voyager (Espagne, Algérie, Italie, Grèce, Turquie, Égypte) et est l'auteur de deux grands romans, ""Le Roman de la momie"" (1858) et ""Le Capitaine Fracasse"" (1863). Il meurt à Neuilly-sur-Seine en 1872.",0.00,5:0|4:0|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:0,0,0,,,fre,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28232982-l-int-grale-de-th-ophile-gautier-tome-3-4

It tells an unhappy tale about three very unlucky children. Even though they are charming and clever, the Baudelaire siblings lead lives filled with misery and woe. From the very first page of this book when the children are at the beach and receive terrible news, continuing on through the entire story, disaster lurks at their heels. One might say they are magnets for misfortune.<br /><br />In this short book alone, the three youngsters encounter a greedy and repulsive villain, itchy clothing, a disastrous fire, a plot to steal their fortune, and cold porridge for breakfast.<br /><br />It is my sad duty to write down these unpleasant tales, but there is nothing stopping you from putting this book down at once and reading something happy, if you prefer that sort of thing.<br /><br />With all due respect,<br /><i>Lemony Snicket</i>",3.93,5:123264|4:123552|3:81241|2:21061|1:7890|total:357008,330791,12932,176,"Scholastic, Inc.",eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1490085391l/78411._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1490085391l/78411._SX50_.jpg,0439206472,9780439206471,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/78411.The_Bad_Beginning

22557,12872236,Canada,Richard Ford,"""First, I'll tell about the robbery our parents committed. Then about the murders, which happened later.""<br /><br />When fifteen-year-old Dell Parsons' parents rob a bank, his sense of normal life is forever altered. In an instant, this private cataclysm drives his life into before and after, a threshold that can never be uncrossed.<br /><br />His parents' arrest and imprisonment mean a threatening and uncertain future for Dell and his twin sister, Berner. Willful and burning with resentment, Berner flees their home in Montana, abandoning her brother and her life. But Dell is not completely alone. A family friend intervenes, spiriting him across the Canadian border, in hopes of delivering him to a better life. There, afloat on the prairie of Saskatchewan, Dell is taken in by Arthur Remlinger, an enigmatic and charismatic American whose cool reserve masks a dark and violent nature.<br /><br />Undone by the calamity of his parents' robbery and arrest, Dell struggles under the vast prairie sky to remake himself and define the adults he thought he once knew. But his search for grace and peace only moves him nearer to a harrowing and murderous collision with Remlinger, an elemental force of darkness.<br /><br />A true masterwork of haunting and spectacular vision from one of America's greatest writers, <i>Canada</i> is a profound novel of boundaries traversed, innocence lost and reconciled, and the mysterious and consoling bonds of family. Told in spare, elegant prose, both resonant and luminous, it is destined to become a modern classic.",3.50,5:4210|4:8483|3:7356|2:2960|1:958|total:23967,20044,3026,420,Ecco,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327927048l/12872236._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327927048l/12872236._SY75_.jpg,0061692042,9780061692048,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12872236-canada

Sure, there were stories that the area was haunted, but there was no way they were true. <br /><br />IT WAS JUST A LOCAL LEGEND <br /><br />Decades earlier, an old goat farmer had been murdered by the Klan, hung from a tree near the bridge solely because of the color of his skin. His body was never found. Since then, numerous sightings of a strange creature—half-man and half-goat—had been reported in the surrounding woods. He was called the Goatman. <br /><br />IT WAS JUST THE WORST NIGHT OF THEIR LIVES <br /><br />From the moment they arrived, strange noises echoed around them… a sense that they were being watched pervaded the campsite… and that was just the beginning. When one of them vanishes and a horned monstrosity pursues the others, it becomes clear that the legends are real. <br /><br />…and the truth is so much more horrific than they could ever have imagined. <br /><br /><br />""Justin M.

22568,12667232,Blue Aloes; Stories of South Africa,Cynthia Stockley,"Excerpt from book: <i>The Leopard PART I It was nine o'clock, and time for the first waltz to strike up. The wide, empty floor of the Falcon Hotel lounge gleamed with a waxen glaze under the brilliant lights, and the dancers' feet were tingling to begin. Michael Walsh, who always played at the Wankelo dances, sat down at the piano and struck two loud arresting bars, then gently caressed from the keys the crooning melody of the Wisteria Waltz. Two by two, the dancers drew into the maze of music and movement, and became part of a weaving rhythmic, kaleidoscopic picture. There was not an ill-looking person in the room. The men were of a tanned, hard-bitten, adventurous brand; the women were nearly all pretty or attractive or both, and mostly young. These are the usual attributes of women in a new country like Rhodesia; for men do not take ugly, unattractive women to share life with them in the wilds, and girls born in such places have a gift all their own of beauty and charm. Many of them were badly dressed, however, for that, too, is an attribute of the wilds, where women mostly make their own clothes, unless they are rich enough to get frequent parcels from England. There wasthis to be noted about the gowns: When they were new, they were patchy affairs, made up at home from materials bought in Rhodesian shops; but when well cut, they were battered and worn. Take, for instance, Mrs. Lisle's gown of pale-green satin and sequins. She had been an actress before she married Barton Lisle and came out to the ups and downs of a mining speculator's life, and all her clothes were richauffees of the toilettes in which she had once dazzled provincial audiences. Gay Liscannon's frock of pale rose-leaf silk, with a skirt that was a flurry of delicious little frills and a bodice of lace, sewn with little p...</i>",3.00,5:0|4:1|3:5|2:1|1:0|total:7,4,0,,Rarebooksclub.com,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1355072271l/12667232._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1355072271l/12667232._SX50_.jpg,0217183204,9780217183208,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12667232-blue-aloes-stories-of-south-africa

He jumped from party to party, gaining fame as a Republican. One of the most learned statesmen of the era, he specialized in foreign affairs, working closely with Abraham Lincoln. He devoted his enormous energies to the destruction of what he considered the Slave Power, that is the conspiracy of slave owners to seize control of the federal government and block the progress of liberty. Sumner was a leading proponent of abolishing slavery to weaken the Confederacy. The annexation of Texas - a new slave-holding state - in 1845 pushed Sumner into taking an active role in the anti-slavery movement. He helped organize an alliance between Democrats and the newly created Free-Soil Party in Massachusetts in 1849. His works include The Duel Between France and Germany (1870), Works (1870) and The Best Portraits in Engraving (1875).",2.00,5:0|4:0|3:1|2:0|1:1|total:2,1,0,48,Dodo Press,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1406551376,9781406551372,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8292942-the-best-portraits-in-engraving

22579,6867836,Bread Overhead,Fritz Leiber,"""Bread Overhead"" is a story Fritz Leiber could have written to send up today's bewildering bread aisle -- all those claims of low-cal and low-low-carb. In fact, the story probably reads better now than it did in 1958, back when the choice came down to white or whole wheat. Leiber slyly imagines a near-future when giant machines not only harvest the wheat field, but grind flour and bake bread on the spot -- the ultimate in big farming. In this toasted tomorrow, the highly-mechanized Puffy Products is bent on producing the supremely lightest loaf. The story is what happens if bread isn't just airy, but pumped full of lighter-than-air helium. Leiber (<i>Ships to the Stars</i>) didn't often bake up such a souffle of spoof, but he's a master in the kitchen. And ""Bread Overhead"" has just enough to say about human nature to be filling, besides.",3.51,5:18|4:45|3:45|2:14|1:2|total:124,97,15,56,Aegypan,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1606642847,9781606642849,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6867836-bread-overhead

The big, gray-haired man who would be Lieutenant Dale Hunter's superior-Strategic Service's Special Agent, George Rockford-opened another can of beer, his fifth. ""There will be intrigue already under way when this helicopter sets down with us. Attempted homicide will soon follow. The former will be meat for me. You will be meat for the latter.""</p> <p>Rockford was smiling as he spoke; the genial, engaging smile of a fond old father. But the eyes, surrounded by laughter crinkles, were as unreadable as two disks of gray slate. They were the eyes of a poker player-or master con man.</p> <p>""I don't understand, sir,"" Hunter said.</p> <p>""Of course not,"" Rockford agreed. ""It's a hundred light-years back to Earth. Here on Vesta, to make sure there <i>is</i> an Earth in the future, you're going to do things never dreamed of by your Terran Space Patrol instructors there. You'll be amazed, my boy.""</p> <p></p> <p>Hunter said nothing but he felt a growing dislike for the condescending Rockford. Only a few weeks ago President Diskar, himself, had said: <i>For more than a century these truly valiant men of the Space Patrol have been our unwavering outer guard; have fought and died by legions, that Earth and the other worlds of the Terran Republic might remain free-</i></p> <p>""I suppose you know,"" Rockford said, ""that there will be no more than four days in which to stop the Verdam oligarchy from achieving its long-time ambition of becoming big enough to swallow the Terran Republic.""</p> <p>""I know,"" Hunter answered.</p> <p>Jardeen, Vesta's companion world, was the key. Jardeen was large and powerful, with a space navy unsurpassed by that of any other single world. A large group of now-neutral worlds would follow Jardeen's lead and Jardeen's alliance with the Verdam People's Worlds would mean the quick end for the Terran Republic. But, if Jardeen could be persuaded to ally with the Terran Republic, the spreading, grasping arms of the Verdam octopus would begin to wither away-</p> <p>Rockford spoke again:</p> <p>""Val Boran, Jardeen's Secretary of Foreign Relations, is the man who will really make Jardeen's decision. I know him slightly. Since my public role is that of Acting Ambassador, he agreed-reluctantly-to come to Vesta so that the talks could be on a neutral world. With him will be Verdam's Special Envoy Sonig; a wily little man who has been working on Boran for several weeks. He seems to be succeeding quite well-here's a message I received from Earth early this morning.""</p>",2.93,5:3|4:1|3:5|2:4|1:2|total:15,9,2,,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6297196-and-devious-the-line-of-duty

22592,47836207,Ifigenio En Taŭrido,Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,"Iphigenia in Tauris is a reworking by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe of the ancient Greek tragedy Ἰφιγένεια ἐν Ταύροις by Euripides. Euripides' title means ""Iphigenia among the Taurians"", whereas Goethe's title means ""Iphigenia in Taurica"", the country of the Tauri.<br /><br />Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, (born August 28, 1749, Frankfurt am Main [Germany]--died March 22, 1832, Weimar, Saxe-Weimar), German poet, playwright, novelist, scientist, statesman, theatre director, critic, and amateur artist, considered the greatest German literary figure of the modern era.<br /> Goethe is the only German literary figure whose range and international standing equal those of Germany's supreme philosophers (who have often drawn on his works and ideas) and composers (who have often set his works to music). In the literary culture of the German-speaking countries, he has had so dominant a position that, since the end of the 18th century, his writings have been described as ""classical."" In a European perspective he appears as the central and unsurpassed representative of the Romantic movement, broadly understood. He could be said to stand in the same relation to the culture of the era that began with the Enlightenment and continues to the present day as William Shakespeare does to the culture of the Renaissance and Dante to the culture of the High Middle Ages. His Faust, though eminently stageworthy when suitably edited, is also Europe's greatest long poem since John Milton's Paradise Lost, if not since Dante's The Divine Comedy.<br /> Early years (1749-69)<br /> Goethe was one of the very few figures of Germany's 18th-century literary renaissance who were, in the full sense of the term, bourgeois. Unlike most of his contemporaries, he had no need, at least in the first half of his life, to seek princely patronage of his writing or employment as an official or an academic. The Frankfurt in which he was born and in which his social attitudes were formed was, as it is now, a wealthy commercial and financial centre, but it was also virtually a self-governing republic, a city-state within the Holy Roman Empire. The nobility and the grand and petty sovereigns who figured so much in Goethe's later life had no part in his early experiences: he was a town child from a rich family in an essentially middle-class world.<br /> His father, Johann Caspar Goethe (1710-82), the son of a wealthy tailor-turned-innkeeper, was a man of leisure who lived on his inherited fortune and devoted himself, after studying law in Leipzig and Strasbourg and touring Italy, France, and the Low Countries, to collecting books and paintings and to the education of his children. Goethe's mother, Catharina Elisabeth Textor (1731-1808), was one of the daughters of Frankfurt's most senior official and was a lively woman closer in age to her son than to her husband. Goethe was the eldest of seven children, though only one other survived into adulthood, his sister Cornelia (1750-77), for whom he felt an intense affection of whose potentially incestuous nature he seems to have been aware. Another emotional factor in the poet's childhood that may have affected his later development was a love-hate relationship with a younger brother, who died in 1759 at age six: Goethe's later relationships with literary contemporaries were ambiguous, though he nonetheless described them as ""brothers,"" and he was repelled by literary and artistic representations of death.",0.00,5:0|4:0|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:0,0,0,77,Lighthouse Books for Translation and Publishing,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1566269904l/47836207._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1566269904l/47836207._SX50_.jpg,0599622059,9780599622050,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/47836207-ifigenio-en-ta-rido

Here are talented tomboy and author-to-be Jo, tragically frail Beth, beautiful Meg, and romantic, spoiled Amy, united in their devotion to each other and their struggles to survive in New England during the Civil War.<br /><p>It is no secret that Alcott based <i>Little Women</i> on her own early life. While her father, the freethinking reformer and abolitionist Bronson Alcott, hobnobbed with such eminent male authors as Emerson, Thoreau, and Hawthorne, Louisa supported herself and her sisters with ""woman’s work,” including sewing, doing laundry, and acting as a domestic servant. But she soon discovered she could make more money writing. <i>Little Women</i> brought her lasting fame and fortune, and far from being the ""girl’s book” her publisher requested, it explores such timeless themes as love and death, war and peace, the conflict between personal ambition and family responsibilities, and the clash of cultures between Europe and America.</p>",4.06,5:622936|4:481219|3:275756|2:76751|1:35320|total:1491982,178,3,,,eng,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1534967907,9781534967908,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32599878-little-women

22608,12061689,"A Book for All Readers : An Aid to the Collection, Use, and Preservation of Books and the Formation of Public and Private Libraries",Ainsworth Rand Spofford,"Ainsworth Rand Spofford was no fan of what he called the ""grassy incubations"" of Walt Whitman. As a thirty-five-year-old newspaper editor in Cincinnati in 1860, Spofford criticized Whitman's poetry on various grounds, including incoherence and indecency: ""What we complain of in Walt Whitman, aside from that gross and obtrusive animalism which disgusts all intellectual men, is his utter contempt for expression, and the formless and apparently aimless character of his productions."" With these comments in mind, it is surprising to find Librarian of Congress Spofford writing to Whitman sixteen years later, asking him to confirm that the six editions of Leaves of Grass held by the Library of Congress were indeed all of the authorized editions. Though Whitman's reputation steadily rose through the late nineteenth century, Spofford had not changed his opinion of the poet's work: he pointedly left Whitman's name out of some original verses celebrating American literary authors in 1900. The narrative that emerges from these events would tend to valorize Spofford as a visionary librarian who put aside his personal taste in the interest of establishing the Library of Congress as a national library with comprehensive collections. The centerpiece of his collection-building efforts, of course, was the copyright deposit law of 1870, which secured for the Library all publications of the American press submitted for copyright protection.<br /><br />My intention in this essay is not to challenge this narrative but to complicate it. Spofford deserves immense credit for the copyright deposit law as well as for his long campaign for a building whose grandeur would be commensurate with the institution's status as a de facto national library. But Spofford was, inevitably, a product of the culture of Victorian America. The growth of professional librarianship in the late nineteenth century took place alongside challenging developments in literary publishing in the United States, and Spofford's career must be understood within these contexts. While arguing passionately for wide inclusion as the guiding principle of collection development at the Library of Congress, Spofford retained a paternalistic ethic of exclusion when it came to personal reading habits and public library selection practices. Moreover, for all of Spofford's eloquence on the principle of inclusion at the Library of Congress, his adverse judgments about the cultural value of popular literature were somewhat reflected in the Library's literary collections and cataloging practices. An analysis of post-1870 Library catalogs along with works Spofford published outside of his official duties as Librarian reveals his ambivalence about the very collections his efforts made possible.<br /><br />The Fiction Question<br /><br />Spofford expressed his philosophy regarding reading practices and library collection policies in A Book for All Readers, published in 1900. In the first chapter, ""The Choice of Books,"" he offered guidelines to librarians and individual readers about the most important subject areas to collect, including bibliographical resources to help them make selections. Spofford advised readers to begin with biographies and histories before proceeding to essays, poetry, travel literature, science, fiction, literary history, and classical literature. His advice on reading in A Book for All Readers squared perfectly with the ideology of reading that drove the library profession in the late nineteenth century. The ideology included several tenets: ""read with a purpose,"" ""read systematically and widely,"" ""digest what you read,"" and read with discrimination. Similar sentiments are found in other influential guides to book collecting, such as Frederic B. Perkins's The Best Reading (first published in 1872), which provided a bibliography of titles along with ""Readings on Reading"" and ""Suggestions for Courses of Reading."" Spofford endorsed the principle of literary selectivity in the eight-volume anthology The Library of Choice Literature, which he coedited with Charles Gibbon in 1883, and in a pamphlet entitled What to Read; When to Read; How to Read, published the same year. Spofford's A Book for All Readers was therefore part of a larger effort among librarians and self-appointed cultural arbiters of the period to shape the reading habits of Americans.<br /><br />Coming as it did after his official retirement as Librarian of Congress, A Book for All Readers represented a capstone to Spofford's long career. By then freer to express his...",4.50,5:1|4:1|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:2,2,1,459,,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1397236649l/12061689._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1397236649l/12061689._SX50_.jpg,,2940017441015,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12061689-a-book-for-all-readers

Chances are, you’ve interacted with one or two of them in your lifetime without even realizing it...</i> <br /><br />Demon hunter Evelyn Brighton saves unsuspecting humans from the malevolent creatures masquerading around them every day. Working under the Lebriga Corporation’s direction, she never fails to bring her A-game with her keen skill, fiercely independent spirit, and the best weapon in her arsenal: the Divinity blade.<br /><br />Evelyn’s world is turned on its ear, however, when she is ordered to train cocky new recruit Daniel Summers. They both feel an instinctive pull drawing them to one another, the ancient spells tattooed into their skin illuminating whenever the two hunters come into contact. But with evil looming over the city of Los Angeles, Evelyn and Daniel’s mutual competitiveness and sense of duty to Lebriga and all humankind forces them to hold back their desires. Will their restraint be enough to keep them focused and save southern California, or will the dark forces prevail?<br /><br />Set in modern-day Los Angeles, <i>Divinity</i> is an action-filled, fast-paced marriage of urban fantasy and paranormal romance. Edgy, witty, and sexy, it will bind you in its spell.",3.61,5:36|4:38|3:31|2:11|1:11|total:127,120,35,200,Omnific Publishing,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1346329277l/13596160._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1346329277l/13596160._SY75_.jpg,,9781623429072,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13596160-divinity

Nel periferico cimitero di Chiaravalle mani ignote profanano una tomba seicentesca e trafugano le spoglie del marchese Ludovico Acerbi, passato alla storia come il «Diavolo di Porta Romana». Sembra un banale episodio di teppismo ma nei giorni successivi, sotto la Madonnina, si verificano in rapida successione tre misteriosi omicidi, compiuti e rivendicati dalla stessa mano. Le vittime portano tutte cognomi di casate che, nella Milano del Seicento, ebbero rivalità con quella del marchese Acerbi.<br />A far luce su questa misteriosa vicenda sono impegnati il commissario Bruno Ardigò, freddo e taciturno, e l’amico giornalista Federico Malerba, solare ed espansivo. Diversi come il giorno e la notte, ma uniti dalla stessa voglia di arrivare alla verità, si addentrano nei meandri oscuri e inquietanti della Milano esoterica, dove nulla è come sembra.",3.88,5:5|4:6|3:4|2:0|1:1|total:16,15,4,720,,ita,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1366628417l/13188409._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1366628417l/13188409._SX50_.jpg,8842546895,9788842546894,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13188409-gli-angeli-di-lucifero

22651,6093003,The Unsolved Riddle of Social Justice,Stephen Leacock,"Stephen Butler Leacock (1869-1944) was a Canadian writer and economist. Leacock, always of obvious intelligence, was sent to the elite private school of Upper Canada College in Toronto, where he was top of the class and so popular he was chosen as head boy. Early in his career Leacock turned to fiction, humour, and short reports to supplement and ultimately exceed his regular income. His stories, first published in magazines in Canada and the United States and later in novel form became extremely popular around the world. It was said in 1911 that more people had heard of Stephen Leacock than had heard of Canada. Although he wrote learned articles and books related to his field of study, his political theory is now all but forgotten. Leacock was awarded the Royal Society of Canada's Lorne Pierce Medal in 1937, nominally for his academic work. Among his famous works are: Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town (1912), Arcadian Adventures with the Idle Rich (1914), Moonbeams from the Larger Lunacy (1915), Frenzied Fiction (1918), and The Hohenzollerns in America (1919).",3.40,5:5|4:12|3:7|2:2|1:4|total:30,20,3,72,Dodo Press,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,140654938X,9781406549386,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6093003-the-unsolved-riddle-of-social-justice

Jane Stewart created the first set of Campfire Girls, which began with A Campfire Girl's First Council Fire. The Girls were best friends Bessie and Zara, and they belonged to the campfire girls (a version of the Girl Scouts). Among their adventures were interacting with the Romany, foiling kidnapers, beating the boys at sports, showing up snooty city girls, and saving Zara's father from a counterfeiting charge. This book begins: Oh, what a glorious day! cried Bessie King, the first of the members of the Manasquan Camp Fire Girls of America to emerge from the sleeping house of Camp Sunset, on Lake Dean, and to see the sun sparkling on the water of the lake. She was not long along in her enjoyment of the scene, however.

22670,7983150,"Jack Wright and His Electric Stage; Or, Leagued Against the James Boys",Noname,"Jack Wright was the hero of a popular series of Victorian science fiction dime novels and story papers written by Luis Senarens, the so-called ""American Jules Verne."" A few stories are also credited to Francis W. Doughty. Jack appeared in original stories from in 1891 to 1896 for a total of 121 stories. Luis Philip Senarens (1863-1939) who wrote under the pseudonyms Police Captain Howard and Noname, was an American dime novel writer specializing in science fiction, once called ""the American Jules Verne."" He grew up in a Cuban-American family in Brooklyn. He took over the Frank Reade adventure story series around 1882, introducing Frank Reade, Jr. as the new main character, and adding elements such as electricity. They were highly successful, and by the 1890s he was asked by publisher Frank Tousey to write a similar series featuring Jack Wright, the Boy Inventor. Mike Ashley calls him ""the first prolific writer of science fiction."" He would eventually write more than 300 dime novels. In 1917 Senarens became the editor of the Tousey detective story periodical, Mystery Magazine. His works include: The Girl Detective (1882), The Mystery of One Night (1882), Young Vidocq (1882), Frank Reade, Jr. and His Steam Wonder (1884), Frank Reade, Jr. in the Clouds (1885), Across the Continent on Wings (1886), The Electric Man; or, Frank Reade, Jr. in Australia (1887) and Frank Reade, Jr. and His Electric Team (1888).",3.12,5:3|4:0|3:1|2:3|1:1|total:8,8,2,188,Dodo Press,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1409960897,9781409960898,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7983150-jack-wright-and-his-electric-stage-or-leagued-against-the-james-boys

22690,21359247,Rembrandt and His Works: Comprising an Account of His Life and a Critical Examination Into His Principles and Practice (Illustrated),John Burnet,"(Illustrated) This book contains illustrations from the work of Rembrandt himself, which are used to illuminate his genius and the principles and practice of design, light, shade, and color in his works.<br /><br />In commencing an account of the life of Rembrandt and his works, I feel both a pleasure and a certain degree of confidence, as, from my first using a pencil, his pictures have been my delight and gratification, which have continued to increase through a long life of investigation. Though I cannot expect to enhance the high estimation in which Rembrandt is held by all persons competent to appreciate his extraordinary powers, nevertheless, the publication of the results of my study may tend to spread a knowledge of his principles and practice, which may be advantageous to similar branches in other schools; for, notwithstanding that his style is in the greatest degree original and peculiar to himself, yet it is founded upon those effects existing in nature which are to be discovered, more or less, in the works of all the great masters of colouring and chiaro-scuro. Of his early life little is known; for, unless cradled in the higher circles of society, the early lives of eminent men frequently remain shrouded in obscurity. The development of their genius alone draws attention to their history, which is generally progressive; hence a retrospective view is ambiguous. Little is known either of Rembrandt's birth or the place of his death; what is known has already been related, from Houbraken to Bryan, and from Bryan to Nieuwenhuys, and anecdotes have accumulated, for something new must be said. It is, however, fortunate that in searching into the source from which this extraordinary artist drew his knowledge, we have only to look into the great book of Nature, which existed at the time of Apelles and Raffaelle; and, notwithstanding the diversity of styles adopted by all succeeding painters, beauties and peculiarities are still left sufficient to establish the highest reputation for any one who has the genius to perceive them, and the industry to make them apparent. This was the cause of Rembrandt's captivating excellence; neither a combination of Coreggio and Titian, nor of Murillo and Velasquez, but as if all the great principles of chiaro-scuro and colour were steeped and harmonized in the softening shades of twilight; and this we perceive in nature, producing the most soothing and bewitching results. These digressions may, however, come more properly into notice when Rembrandt's principles of colour come under review.",4.00,5:5|4:3|3:3|2:1|1:0|total:12,0,0,,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21359247-rembrandt-and-his-works

She had soft gray eyes, a pretty color in her cheeks, rosy lips, and a charming figure. In the course of the evening somebody suggested mind-reading as a pastime, and Lansing, who had some powers, or supposed powers, in that direction, although he laughed at them himself, experimented in turn with the ladies. He failed with nearly every subject until it came Mary Hollister's turn. As she placed her soft palm in his, closed her eyes, and gave herself up to his influence, he knew that he should succeed with her, and so he did. She proved a remarkably sympathetic subject, and Lansing was himself surprised, and the spectators fairly thrilled, by the feats he was able to perform by her aid. After that evening he met her often, and there was more equally remarkable mind-reading; and then mind-reading was dropped for heart-reading, and the old, old story they read in each other's hearts had more fascination for them than the new science.",3.20,5:0|4:1|3:4|2:0|1:0|total:5,0,0,,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29283178-at-pinney-s-ranch

Odysseus' reliance on his wit and wiliness for survival in his encounters with divine and natural forces, during his ten-year voyage home to Ithaca after the Trojan War, is at once a timeless human story and an individual test of moral endurance. <br /><br />In the myths and legends that are retold here, Fagles has captured the energy and poetry of Homer's original in a bold, contemporary idiom, and given us an <i>Odyssey</i> to read aloud, to savor, and to treasure for its sheer lyrical mastery.<br /><br />Renowned classicist Bernard Knox's superb Introduction and textual commentary provide new insights and background information for the general reader and scholar alike, intensifying the strength of Fagles' translation.<br /><br />This is an <i>Odyssey</i> to delight both the classicist and the public at large, and to captivate a new generation of Homer's students.<br /><br />--<br /><br />Robert Fagles, winner of the PEN/Ralph Manheim Medal for Translation and a 1996 Academy Award in Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, presents us with Homer's best-loved and most accessible poem in a stunning new modern-verse translation.",3.75,5:242485|4:254580|3:201330|2:70885|1:32409|total:801689,744230,6392,541,Penguin Classics,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1390173285l/1381._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1390173285l/1381._SY75_.jpg,0143039954,9780143039952,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1381.The_Odyssey

22718,20934390,"Cathedrals and Cloisters of the South of France, Volume 1",Elise Whitlock Rose,"For years the makers of this book have spent the summer time in wandering about the French country; led here by the fame of some old monument, or there by an incident of history. They have found the real, unspoiled France, often unexplored by any except the French themselves, and practically unknown to foreigners, even to the ubiquitous maker of guide-books. For weeks together they have travelled without meeting an English-speaking person. It is, therefore, not surprising that they were unable to find, in any convenient form in English, a book telling of the Cathedrals of the South which was at once accurate and complete. For the Cathedrals of that country are monuments not only of architecture and its history, but of the history of peoples, the psychology of the christianising and unifying of the barbarian and the Gallo-Roman, and many things besides, epitomised perhaps in the old words, -the struggle between the world, the flesh, and the devil.- In French, works on Cathedrals are numerous and exhaustive; but either so voluminous as to be unpractical except for the specialist as the volumes of Viollet-le-Duc, or so technical as to make each Cathedral seem one in an endless, monotonous procession, differing from the others only in size, style, and age.",5.00,5:2|4:0|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:2,2,0,,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20934390-cathedrals-and-cloisters-of-the-south-of-france-volume-1

22729,18603996,Testamento Poetico,Coelho Sousa,"A obra poetica de Coelho de Sousa tem caracteristicas singulares. Alguma tem um tom coloquial e intimista voltada para os seus dramas pessoais, no choque entre a sua fina sensibilidade, as opcoes religiosas de fundo e as suas incertezas de realizacao e sublimacao. E uma permanente busca de superacao dos limites humanos, da sua debilidade e limitacoes pessoais e a exigencia da transcendencia de um ideal que o orienta, que aponta um destino final, mas nao lhe da conforto e certezas inabalaveis para o choque e o confronto com a realidade humana e social. O que se traduz por uma poesia angustiada e atormentada. Um exemplo: Ja cai de maduro o fruto da vida que trago em mim e sou o que sou assim misterio ou enigma seguro na teia do tempo com asas de vento e olhos de fogo em que me procuro. A outra face da sua poetica e aquela que brota do seu profundo e vital enraizamento na sua sociedade, na sua cultura e no seu povo. Nascido e vivendo no meio do povo, participa e exprime poeticamente as suas alegrias e tristezas. Canta o povo terceirense e acoriano e as suas tradicoes, usos e vivencias. Um exemplo: Gentes do campo em descanso Couves ao lume para a ceia... Como e belo, como e manso O fim do dia na aldeia. Este profundo enraizamento no povo e suas manifestacoes artisticas da-lhe oportunidade de um outro tipo de poesia, que tem o tom, a leveza, a simplicidade do melhor que se escreveu em quadras de gosto popular. Atirei pedras ao mar Sem o mar me fazer mal Quanto mais pedras atiro Mais o mar se fica igual. Quantas pedras atirei Todas se foram ao fundo. So nao lhes posso atirar Pedras que me atira o mundo... Neste jogo de pedrada Cada pedra cai na agua. Umas caem sobre o mar Outras nas ondas da magoa. Poesia da transcendencia. Poesia da imanencia. Poesia das vivencias pessoais. Poesia das vivencias colectivas. Poesia. Sempre poesia. Outras duas tematicas centrais na poesia de Coelho de Sousa, sao o mar e ilha. Vive poeticamente a sua condicao de ilheu, nestas duas dimensoes indissociaveis. Ao mar, dedica tres conjuntos de poemas para falar e cantar, o mar-saudade, o mar-espelho e o mar e a dor. Tens um segredo qualquer Que me queres revelar Qual seja podes dizer Que o guardarei, lindo mar. Quanto a ilha, ela assumira duas dimensoes na poesia de Coelho de Sousa: A ilha fisica, em que ele geograficamente vive, e a ilha mitica do amor-por-vir. Palmo a palmo, passo a passo Desde o vale ate a serra, Vou por essa ilha fora dar a volta a minha terra. Quanto a ilha mitica, projeccao dos seus anseios e aspiracoes, ele dira, a encerrar um poema: Importa conquistar a liberdade... E sobre o mar ha-de surgir a ilha do amor por vir, alegre e sem horror. Aqui unem-se os dois temas: a ilha e o mar. Nao uma ilha qualquer, mas a ilha-do-amor- por-vir. Nao um mar qualquer, mas um mar"" alegre e sem horror."" Ainda mais um breve referencia a duas dimensoes e enquadramentos da poesia de Coelho de Sousa. Coelho de Sousa e tambem o poeta da condicao humana e o poeta da condicao crista e da poesia religiosa. Exemplos ao acaso: Que a todos chegue a ventura Toda a boca tenha pao, Toda a nudez cobertura, Toda a dor consolacao... E este outro: Cada manha que se rasga Na claridade do sol, E um canto de alegria No canto do rouxinol No trinar da cotovia. Quanto a condicao crista, um exemplo: E fiz que o tempo as maos pusesse ao pe de um berco.. Os anjos em redor rezaram como irmaos. E eu fiquei, no teu divino amor, imerso. Exemplo da poesia dos temas religiosos: Tu sabes bem que e verdade: Longe de Deus, a vida e nada! E todos temos saudade da felicidade passada Que nao ha frutos sem sol, Nem dia sem arrebol! Que a noite e feia sem lua E a vida assim nao e tua. Esta visao sumaria e resumida da poesia de Coelho de Sousa permite-nos dizer que nele, o humano demasiado humano conviveu poeticamente com o divino, demasiado divino.",0.00,5:0|4:0|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:0,0,0,374,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1382929318l/18603996._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1382929318l/18603996._SX50_.jpg,1492707066,9781492707066,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18603996-testamento-poetico

She was born the only daughter and heiress of Colonel Frederick Custance, who was a wealthy and distinguished soldier in the British army. In 1902, she eloped and married Lord Alfred Douglas. A year later They had one child, however, the marriage was stormy, after Douglas became a Catholic in 1911. They separated in 1913, lived together for a time in the 1920s after Olive also converted, and then lived apart after she gave up Catholicism. Their son, Raymond, showed signs of instability in his youth. For a time he served in the army, but was often confined to mental institutions for long periods. This further strained the marriage, which by the end of the 1920's was all but over. Her works include: Opals (1897), Rainbows (1902), The Blue Bird (1905) and The Inn of Dreams (1911).",3.67,5:1|4:2|3:3|2:0|1:0|total:6,2,1,48,Dodo Press,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1406585688,9781406585681,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3097511-the-inn-of-dreams

Soon after the friends depart, they seek shelter from a storm in an old farmhouse and are frightened by a couple of rough-looking gypsies. Ruth hears the men discussing a wealthy old woman, a valuable necklace, and how they will no longer take risks for her. Ruth wonders what it all means.<br /><br />Later, the chums continue on their way, but Tom's car breaks down. He goes for help, leaving Ruth and Helen alone. Some gypsies offer to help Ruth and Helen, but Ruth is suspicious. Helen insists that they accept the gypsies' help and leaves a note for Tom. Unknown to the two girls, the gypsies remove the note, leaving no clue as to where the girls went. Soon after the girls join the gypsy caravan, they realize that they are in danger. The gypsies intend to keep them captive and demand ransom from their families.<br />	<br />He pushed Ruth roughly back into her seat.<br />While captive, Ruth sees the valuable necklace which is in possession of the queen of the gypsies.

Upon their arrival at the school, Ruth learns that a five-thousand dollar reward has been offered for the recovery of a valuable necklace that was stolen from the aunt of a new student. Ruth sorely wants to become independent of her Uncle Jabez, whose allowance is offered so grudgingly.

Rags' owner was very angry.<br /><br />""That's the last slipper of mine that you'll chew up!"" he said, and<br />sped away.<br /><br />Rags stood in the street.<br /><br />""So that was it,"" he thought. ""But he had so many slippers in his<br />closet, how was I to know he'd mind if I just chewed a few?""<br /><br />The street was wide and empty and Rags was frightened. What was a<br />small dog to do? What could he do? Of course ... he must find another<br />home!<br /><br />Suddenly Rags grew up. He would never again chew a slipper! Up on the<br />sidewalk he scrambled, ready for adventure. He didn't feel sad at all<br />now.<br /><br />""Surely,"" he thought, ""I can soon find a nice home.""<br /><br />He walked down the sidewalk looking at every house. In front of one<br />was a lady watering her flowers. Rags walked up to her politely.<br /><br />""Woof! Woof!"" he said, and wagged his tail.<br /><br />The lady turned.<br /><br />""Oh, you dirty, ragged creature!"" she cried, ""Get off my lawn!"" And<br />with that, she turned the water upon him.<br /><br />Rags ran. He didn't want a home in that lady's house--or in her<br />neighborhood.<br /><br />Cold and wet and frightened, he ran along the street. He was too<br />tired to run any more, when he saw a man rocking on the porch of a<br />very pretty house. Perhaps this man would give him a home. Rags stood<br />still. Did he dare go up and ask him? Timidly, he crept up, stood<br />very still, and wagged his tail.<br /><br />The man looked over his glasses and said, ""Well! Well!""<br /><br />Rags looked up and said, ""Woof!"" which meant in dog language, ""I need<br />a home.""<br /><br />Rags didn't see the cat on the arm of the man's chair. He didn't know<br />she was there until, arching her back, she sprang forward and landed<br />on his face.<br /><br />""Rrrow!"" she screeched. Her claws were sharp. She was telling him,<br />""This is my home! GO AWAY!""<br /><br />Rags ran. ""Yip-yip-yip-yip-yip,"" he cried. He ran and ran. The houses<br />were smaller now, and not so close together. He saw some boxes on a<br />vacant lot. He went over, crawled into one, and went to sleep.<br /><br />The boxes belonged to a little boy named Gary. He was building a<br />playhouse with them. And as soon as he had carried in the wood and<br />swept the walks, he would call, ""Grandma, everything's done! May I<br />play in my box house now?""<br /><br />""Yes, dear,"" said Grandma.<br />",4.04,5:26|4:11|3:11|2:2|1:3|total:53,41,5,5,Public Domain Books,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1340834970l/9680774._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1340834970l/9680774._SY75_.jpg,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9680774-rags

When, at age fifteen, Rosalie decides they should run away to Chicago, Fanny jumps at the chance to escape her unexceptional life. But, within a year, Rosalie commits an unforgivable betrayal, inciting Frances to strike out on her own.<br /><br />Decades later, the women reconnect in San Francisco and realize how widely their lives have diverged. While Rosalie is a housewife and mother, Frances works as a secretary for the Office of Naval Intelligence. There she is introduced to Ainslie Conway, an intelligence operator ten years her junior. When it’s arranged for Frances and Ainslie to marry and carry out a mission on the Galápagos Islands, the couple’s identities—already hidden from each other—are further buried under their new cover stories. No longer a lonely spinster, Frances is about to begin the most fascinating and intrigue-filled years of her life.<br /><br />Amid active volcanoes, forbidding wildlife and flora, and unfriendly neighbors, Ainslie and Frances carve out a life for themselves. But the secrets they harbor from their enemies and from each other may be their undoing.<br /><br />Drawing on the rich history of the early twentieth century and set against a large, colorful canvas, <i>Enchanted Islands</i> boldly examines the complexity of female friendship, the universal pursuit of a place to call home, and the reverberations of secrets we keep from others and from ourselves.",3.74,5:500|4:1221|3:812|2:153|1:33|total:2719,2418,388,306,Nan A.

22764,6226040,On the Origin of Species: By Means of Natural Selection or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life,Charles Darwin,"No ISBN.<br />'One general law, leading to the advancement of all organic beings, namely, multiply, vary, let the strongest live and the weakest die.'<br /><br />When first published in 1859, its central theory - that the natural order was not permanent and unchanging but a gradual process of evolution - met with fierce opposition. How dare any man challenge the concept of divine creation? But the first edition sold out within a day (it has remained in print ever since), its author was declared the most dangerous man in England, and a new era in human thought had begun. The seeds of Darwin's explosive ideas had planted themselves in his mind when, as a young scientist on a five-year voyage of exploration on board HMS Beagle, he tramped around the tropical forests of Brazil, made sketches of the fossil-packed strata of Patagonia, experienced the geological drama of the Andes, and encountered the extraordinary animal life of the Galapagos Islands. But, on his return, a fear of the probable impact of his discoveries also took root. Darwin was himself a deeply religious man and, unsurprisingly perhaps, spent twenty years in rigorous intellectual enquiry, exhaustive experiments and soul-searching before, finally, an anxiety that someone else would get there first spurred him to go public.<br /><br /> In its essence, On the Origin of Species is the story of how life, once begun, developed in its amazing diversity and complexity; the story of a world in which species have come and gone, adapting themselves to changing climates and environments as best they could; the story of the survival of the fittest. That it remains one of the most dazzling and influential books ever written is a testament to the immense energy and startling simplicity with which Darwin makes his revelations.<br /><br /> ‘The theory of natural selection is a prime candidate for the title of the greatest idea ever to occur to a human mind’ <br />RICHARD DAWKINS",3.98,5:35675|4:27078|3:17662|2:5060|1:3111|total:88586,16,4,415,Folio Society,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1342986310l/6226040._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1342986310l/6226040._SY75_.jpg,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6226040-on-the-origin-of-species

22767,2897159,Pagan Passions,Randall Garrett,"The Gods and Goddesses of Ancient Greece and Rome had returned to Earth -- with all their awesome powers intact. Overnight, Earth was transformed. War on any scale was outlawed, along with boom-and-bust economic cycles, and prudery. No change was more startling than the face of New York, where the Empire State Building became the Tower of Zeus. In this totally altered world, William Forrester is an acolyte of Athena, Goddess of Wisdom, and a teacher of history. Only Maya Wilson, one of his students and a worshipper of Venus, Goddess of Love, had a different sort of grading in mind. Maya is the first of the many Trials of Forrester, every bit as mighty and perilous as the Labors of Hercules. In love with Gerda Symes (like him, a devotee of Athena and a frequenter of the great Temple of Pallas Athena -- formerly known as the 42nd Street Library) and dedicated to the pleasures of the mind -- Forrester falls under the soft, compelling pressure of soft, compelling devotees of Venus and Bacchus. He's going to be in need of all the strength that he and his Goddess, the beautiful and intellectual Athena, can muster!<br /><br />Into this sensuous strife stride the Temple Myrmidons -- religious cops sworn to obey orders without question or hesitation -- with a pickup order for William Forrester. Where he is taken, what happens to him, and the truly fantastic discoveries he makes about himself and the Gods and Goddesses ... here are the ingredients that make up this science fiction novel of suspense, intrigue, mystery and danger!",2.97,5:10|4:25|3:50|2:35|1:7|total:127,111,17,132,Wildside Press,eng,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1434492435,9781434492432,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2897159-pagan-passions

22791,40761466,King Henry the Fifth Arranged for Representation at the Princess's Theatre,Charles John Kean,"King Henry the Fifth Arranged for Representation at the Princess's Theatre by Charles John Kean PREFACE. In the selection of my last Shakespearean revival at the Princess's Theatre, I have been actuated by a desire to present some of the finest poetry of our great dramatic master, interwoven with a subject illustrating a most memorable era in English history. No play appears to be better adapted for this two-fold purpose than that which treats of Shakespeare's favorite hero, and England's favorite king-Henry the Fifth. The period thus recalled is flattering to our national pride; and however much the general feeling of the present day may be opposed to the evils of war, there are few amongst us who can be reminded of the military renown achieved by our ancestors on the fields of Crecy, Poitiers, and Agincourt, without a glow of patriotic enthusiasm. The political motives which induced the invasion of France in the year 1415 must be sought for in the warlike spirit of the times, and in the martial character of the English sovereign. We are delighted to publish this classic book as part of our extensive Classic Library collection. Many of the books in our collection have been out of print for decades, and therefore have not been accessible to the general public. The aim of our publishing program is to facilitate rapid access to this vast reservoir of literature, and our view is that this is a significant literary work, which deserves to be brought back into print after many decades. The contents of the vast majority of titles in the Classic Library have been scanned from the original works. To ensure a high quality product, each title has been meticulously hand curated by our staff. Our philosophy has been guided by a desire to provide the reader with a book that is as close as possible to ownership of the original work. We hope that you will enjoy this wonderful classic work, and that for you it becomes an enriching experience.",0.00,5:0|4:0|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:0,0,0,96,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1531163453l/40761466._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1531163453l/40761466._SY75_.jpg,1722384670,9781722384678,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40761466-king-henry-the-fifth-arranged-for-representation-at-the-princess-s-theat

22800,35031085,Frankenstein,Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley,"<b>Mary Shelley</b> began writing <i>Frankenstein</i> when she was only eighteen. At once a Gothic thriller, a passionate romance, and a cautionary tale about the dangers of science, <i>Frankenstein</i> tells the story of committed science student Victor Frankenstein. Obsessed with discovering the cause of generation and life and bestowing animation upon lifeless matter, Frankenstein assembles a human being from stolen body parts but; upon bringing it to life, he recoils in horror at the creature's hideousness. Tormented by isolation and loneliness, the once-innocent creature turns to evil and unleashes a campaign of murderous revenge against his creator, Frankenstein.<br /><br /><i>Frankenstein</i>, an instant bestseller and an important ancestor of both the horror and science fiction genres, not only tells a terrifying story, but also raises profound, disturbing questions about the very nature of life and the place of humankind within the cosmos: What does it mean to be human? What responsibilities do we have to each other? How far can we go in tampering with Nature? In our age, filled with news of organ donation genetic engineering, and bio-terrorism, these questions are more relevant than ever.",3.79,5:309115|4:360848|3:266092|2:83694|1:33393|total:1053142,118782,3864,288,Penguin Classics,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1498841231l/35031085._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1498841231l/35031085._SY75_.jpg,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35031085-frankenstein

22804,21948231,Apron Strings,Mary Morony,"<p>When a grown-up tells you not to worry, you had better start—first rule of thumb, Sallee Mackey, age seven. She is already more than a little bit wary of the adults in her Jim Crow era, Southern world with good reason. Sallee’s mother Ginny is flat out dangerous; her father Joe is on his way out the door; and Mr. Dabney the bigoted neighbor seems to be just a little too interested with the goings on at Sallee’s house—like he knows something no one else does. The only adult to be trusted is Ethel, the family maid, who has known Sallee’s mother since Ethel and Ginny were both girls.</p> <br /> <br /><p>That complicated relationship started the day Ethel spied Ginny kissing the black stable boy years ago. While Ginny has conveniently forgotten that she even knew Ethel back then, Sallee has not as she constantly lobs questions at Ethel about her mother’s girlhood.</p> <br /> <br /><p>From Sallee’s oft times humorous and always guileless vantage, grownups have a most mixed up view of the world. What does skin color have to do with learning? Closing schools rather than have black and white children in the same classroom, what’s the sense of that? </p> <br /> <br /><p>Ethel gives her very own biased account of her shared history with Ginny while Sallee hones her vigilance and stealth, skills she and her brother and two sisters have acquired in an attempt to understand the drama that swirls around them. Rocks are thrown through windows, a car filled with angry white men shout racial slurs at the children at play and a tragic poisoning threatens the entire family’s sense of security.</p> <br /><p>When Joe Mackey asks Ethel to testify on his behalf in a custody suit, her conflicted loyalties throw the entire family into even more turmoil.</p>",3.49,5:125|4:225|3:243|2:86|1:22|total:701,637,62,,,eng,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21948231-apron-strings

Within the black-and-white striped canvas tents is an utterly unique experience full of breathtaking amazements. It is called Le Cirque des Rêves, and it is only open at night. <br /><br />But behind the scenes, a fierce competition is underway—a duel between two young magicians, Celia and Marco, who have been trained since childhood expressly for this purpose by their mercurial instructors. Unbeknownst to them, this is a game in which only one can be left standing, and the circus is but the stage for a remarkable battle of imagination and will. Despite themselves, however, Celia and Marco tumble headfirst into love—a deep, magical love that makes the lights flicker and the room grow warm whenever they so much as brush hands. <br /><br />True love or not, the game must play out, and the fates of everyone involved, from the cast of extraordinary circus performers to the patrons, hang in the balance, suspended as precariously as the daring acrobats overhead. <br /><br />Written in rich, seductive prose, this spell-casting novel is a feast for the senses and the heart.",4.04,5:243622|4:197794|3:105495|2:36363|1:14382|total:597656,529625,53414,391,Doubleday,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1387124618l/9361589._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1387124618l/9361589._SY75_.jpg,0385534639,9780385534635,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9361589-the-night-circus

22879,8075804,Paul Patoff,F. Marion Crawford,"Francis Marion Crawford (1854-1909) was an American writer noted for his many novels. He was born at Bagni di Lucca, Italy. In 1879 he went to India, where he studied Sanskrit and edited the Allahabad Indian Herald. Returning to America he continued to study Sanskrit at Harvard University for a year, contributed to various periodicals, and in 1882 produced his first novel, Mr Isaacs. This book had an immediate success, and its author's promise was confirmed by the publication of Doctor Claudius: A True Story (1883). After a brief residence in New York and Boston, in 1883 he returned to Italy, where he made his permanent home. He also published the historical works, Ave Roma Immortalis (1898), Rulers of the South (1900) renamed Sicily, Calabria and Malta in 1904, and Gleanings from Venetian History (1905). The Saracinesca series is perhaps known to be his best work, with the third in the series, Don Orsino, set against the background of a real estate bubble, told with effective concision.

Tho' IK eep out betimes in the morning, Still the flowers are up the first; Then I try and talk to the robin, And perhaps he'd chat-if he durst. Will you be my little wife, If I ask you? Do! I'll buy you such a Sunday frock, A nice umbrella, too. And you shall have a little hat, With such a long white feather, A pair of gloves, and sandal shoes, The softest kind of leather. And you shall have a tiny house, A beehive full of bees, A little cow, a largish cat, And green sage cheese. You see, merry Phillis, that dear little maid, Has invited Belinda to tea; Her nice little garden is shaded by trees- What pleasanter place could there be? There's a cake full of plums, there are strawberries too, And the table is set on the green; I'm fond of a carpet all daisies and grass- Could a prettier picture be seen? A blackbird (yes, blackbirds delight in warm weather, ) Is flitting from yonder high spray; He sees the two little ones talking together- No wonder the blackbird is gay!

22897,5296,An Ideal Husband,Oscar Wilde,"Although Oscar Wilde (1854–1900) created a wide range of poetry, essays, and fairy tales (and one novel) in his brief, tragic life, he is perhaps best known as a dramatist. His witty, clever drama, populated by brilliant talkers skilled in the art of riposte and paradox, are still staples of the theatrical repertoire.<br /><i>An Ideal Husband</i> revolves around a blackmail scheme that forces a married couple to reexamine their moral standards — providing, along the way, a wry commentary on the rarity of politicians who can claim to be ethically pure. A supporting cast of young lovers, society matrons, an overbearing father, and a formidable femme fatale continually exchange sparkling repartee, keeping the play moving at a lively pace.<br />Like most of Wilde's plays, this scintillating drawing-room comedy is wise, well-constructed, and deeply satisfying. An instant success at its 1895 debut, the play continues to delight audiences over one hundred years later. <i>An Ideal Husband</i> is a must-read for Wilde fans, students of English literature, and anyone delighted by wit, urbanity, and timeless sophistication.",4.04,5:11817|4:14136|3:7294|2:1143|1:291|total:34681,32614,871,78,Dover Publications,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1417045098l/5296._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1417045098l/5296._SY75_.jpg,048641423X,9780486414232,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5296.An_Ideal_Husband
22898,16122774,Elegias,Friedrich Hölderlin,"Poeta contemporâneo dos Românticos, mas de pendor classicizante, deixou nas suas Elegias, escritas por volta do ano 1800, um dos maiores testemunhos da sua genialidade poética. Nestas ""Elegias"", Hölderlin manifesta a simpatia que nutria pela cultura classicista, cujos valores estéticos gostava de cultivar na sua poesia. Assim, escritas em verso, os temas destas Elegias estão, regra geral, relacionados com o culto do belo e/ou a mitologia clássica de origem pagã. Partindo de cenários extraordinários (como o amor de dois deuses), mas também de situações mais frequentes (como o regresso a casa dos pais, ou um passeio pelo campo), o autor constrói quadros idílicos.

</b><br /><br /><b>They come first.</b><br /><br />My vision was growing dimmer, the blackness and ghosts closing in. I swore it was like I could hear Robert whispering in my ear: <i>The world of the dead won't give you up a second time.</i> Just before the light completely vanished, I saw Dimitri's face join Lissa's. I wanted to smile. I decided then that if the two people I loved most were safe, I could leave this world.<br /><br /><i>The dead could finally have me.</i><br /><br /><br /><b>Rose Hathaway has always played by her own rules.</b> She broke the law when she ran away from St. Vladimir's Academy with her best friend and last surviving Dragomir princess, Lissa. She broke the law when she fell in love with her gorgeous, off-limits instructor, Dimitri. And she dared to defy Queen Tatiana, leader of the Moroi world, risking her life and reputation to protect generations of dhampir guardians to come.<br /><br />Now the law has finally caught up with Rose - for a crime she didn't even commit. She's in prison for the highest offense imaginable: the assassination of a monarch. She'll need help from both Dimitri and Adrian to find the one living person who can stall her execution and force the Moroi elite to acknowledge a shocking new candidate for the royal throne: Vasilisa Dragomir.<br /><br />But the clock on Rose's life is running out. Rose knows in her heart the world of the dead wants her back...and this time she is truly out of second chances. The big question is, when your whole life is about saving others, who will save you?<br /><br />Join Rose, Dimitri, Adrian, and Lissa in <i>Last Sacrifice</i>, the epic, unforgettable finale to Richelle Mead's international #1 bestselling <i>Vampire Academy</i> series.",4.40,5:148130|4:61711|3:25764|2:6469|1:3656|total:245730,232566,9382,594,Razorbill,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1319850978l/6527740._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1319850978l/6527740._SX50_.jpg,1595143068,9781595143068,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6527740-last-sacrifice

22943,3468650,The Nebuly Coat,John Meade Falkner,"'A superbly entertaining book, worthy to be shelved somewhere near <i>The Mystery of Edwin Drood</i>, <i>The Nine Tailors</i>, and <i>Ghost Stories of an Antiquary</i>' —Michael Dirda<br /> <br /><br />First published in 1903, John Meade Falkner's <i>The Nebuly Coat</i> has drawn praise from writers as diverse as Thomas Hardy, Graham Greene, E. M. Forster, John Betjeman, Henry Newboldt, and A. N. Wilson; while Lady Violet Bonham Carter, visiting a munitions works in 1915, fell into conversation with one of the directors, with whom she began discussing books. She told him that there was one book that he must read; 'I cannot tell you why, because its quality is indescribable—it is called <i>The Nebuly Coat</i>..' 'I wrote it,' replied the director.<br /><br />The novel tells of the experiences of a young architect, Arthur Westray, who is despatched to the sleepy Dorset town of Cullerne to oversee restoration work on the once splendid, but now sadly deteriorated, Cullerne Minster. The project would seem to offer little by way of excitement: Cullerne is quietly dying, and Westray fears that any restoration efforts are doomed through lack of finance. He soon finds himself, rather unwillingly, caught up in the current of Cullerne life, and hears rumours about a mystery surrounding the claim to the title of Lord Blandamer, whose family vault is sited in Cullerne Minster, and whose arms—the Nebuly Coat—adorn the Minster's great transept window. When the new Lord Blandamer arrives, promising to pay all the costs of the restoration, the inhabitants rejoice—all except Westray, who suspects that the new Lord is not what he seems, and the gone-to-seed organist, Sharnall, who seems close to sovling the mystery of the Blandamer inheritance.<br /><br />Part social comedy, part Hardyesque tragedy, and part murder mystery, <i>The Nebuly Coat</i> stands unique among English novels, and Ash-Tree Press is pleased to be able to bring it back into print. Mark Valentine's introduction illuminates the life of the author of three fine novels (Moonfleet, The Lost Stradivarius, and The Nebuly Coat), and shows how Falkner's interests contributed to this, his final and wonderfully atmospheric novel, a classic tale of suspense, intrigue, and deception.<br /><br /><i>The Nebuly Coat</i> is truly the mystery novel that M. R. James might have written!",3.92,5:40|4:53|3:30|2:6|1:3|total:132,70,16,296,Ash-Tree Press,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1416098274l/3468650._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1416098274l/3468650._SY75_.jpg,1553100735,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3468650-the-nebuly-coat

And the Young Electrician who lolled across the car aisle was neither one length nor another, but most inordinately flexible, like a suit of chain armor. <br /><br />More than being short and quick, the Traveling Salesman was distinctly fat and unmistakably dressy in an ostentatiously new and pure-looking buff-colored suit, and across the top of the shiny black sample-case that spanned his knees he sorted and re-sorted with infinite earnestness a large and varied consignment of ""Ladies' Pink and Blue Ribbed Undervests."" <br /><br />Surely no other man in the whole southward-bound Canadian train could have been at once so ingenuous and so nonchalant. There was nothing dressy, however, about the Young Electrician. From his huge cowhide boots to the lead smouch that ran from his rough, square chin to the very edge of his astonishingly blond curls, he was one delicious mess of toil and old clothes and smiling, blue-eyed indifference. And every time that he shrugged his shoulders or crossed his knees he jingled and jangled incongruously among his coil-boxes and insulators, like some splendid young Viking of old, half blacked up for a modern minstrel show. <br /><br />More than being absurdly blond and absurdly messy, the Young Electrician had one of those extraordinarily sweet, extraordinarily vital, strangely mysterious, utterly unexplainable masculine faces that fill your senses with an odd, impersonal disquietude, an itching unrest, like the hazy, teasing reminder of some previous existence in a prehistoric cave, or, more tormenting still, with the tingling, psychic prophecy of some amazing emotional experience yet to come.

Yet lest you find in this general combination of circumstances some sinister threat of audacity, let me conventionalize the story at once by opening it at that most conventional of all conventional Christmas-story hours, - the Twilight of Christmas Eve. Nuff said? - Christmas Eve, you remember? Twilight? Awfully cold weather? And somebody very young? Now for the story itself! <br /><br />After five blustering, wintry weeks of village speculation and gossip there was of course considerable satisfaction in being the first to solve the mysterious holiday tenancy of the Rattle-Pane House. Breathless with excitement Flame Nourice telephoned the news from the village post-office. <br /><br />From a pedestal of boxes fairly bulging with red-wheeled go-carts, one keen young elbow rammed for balance into a gay glassy shelf of stick-candy, green tissue garlands tickling across her cheek, she sped the message to her mother. <br /><br />""O Mother-Funny!"" triumphed Flame. ""I've found out who's Christmasing at the Rattle-Pane House! It's a red-haired setter dog with one black ear! And he's sitting at the front gate this moment! Superintending the unpacking of the furniture van! And I've named him Lopsy!"" <br /><br />""Why, Flame; how absurd!"" gasped her mother. In consideration of the fact that Flame's mother had run all the way from the icy-footed chicken yard to answer the telephone it shows distinctly what stuff she was made of that she gasped nothing else.",3.02,5:11|4:9|3:12|2:18|1:6|total:56,33,9,134,,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1427769169l/1195469._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1427769169l/1195469._SY75_.jpg,1428081461,9781428081468,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1195469.Peace_On_Earth_Good_Will_To_Dogs

I wonder if the rogues babble when my spirit is nesting ? Last night you were a high tree and I was in it, the wind blowing us both; but I forget the rest,whatever, it was enough to make me wake happy. There are dreams that go out like candle-light directly one opens the shutters: they illumine the walls no longer; the daylight is too strong for them. So, now, I can hardly remember anything of my dreams : daylight, with you in it, floods them out. Oh, how are you ? Awake ? Up ? Have you breakfasted ? I ask you a thousand things. You are thinking of me, I know : but what are you thinking ?I am devoured by curiosity about myself none at all about you, whom I have all by heart! If I might only know how happy I make you, and just which thing I said yesterday is making you laugh to-dayI could cry with joy over being the person I am. It is you who make me think so much about myself, trying to find myself out. I used to be most self-possessed, and regarded it as the crowning virtue: and nowyour possession of me sweeps it away, and I stand crying to be let into a secret that is no longer mine. Shall I ever know why you love me ? It is my religious difficulty ; but it never rises into a doubt. You do love me, I know. Why, I don't think I ever can know. Yet ask me the same question about yourself, and it becomes absurd,because I altogether belong to you. If I hold my breath for a moment wickedly (for I can't do it breathing), and try to look at the world with you out of it, I seem to have fallen over a precipice; or rather, the solid earth has slipped from under my feet, and I am off into vacuum. Then, as I take breath again for fear, my...",3.91,5:3|4:5|3:2|2:1|1:0|total:11,6,1,,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8845911-an-englishwoman-s-love-letters

Also includes the original—complete with uncorrected spelling.</b><br /><br /><i>Love and Freindship</i> was written when Jane Austen was just 14, and foreshadows the conflict between moral obligation and individual desire which animates Austen's mature comedic efforts such as <i>Sense and Sensibility</i>. Now updated in this sparkling satire, the story follows Isabel and her daughter Marianne when they attend the theater and encounter Isabel's old friend, Laura Lindsay, who gives her journal to Marianne to read. It is a revelation to the younger woman as she reads of one hilarious madcap romantic escapade after another. There is love at first sight, marriage the same day, the befriending of another young woman as romantic as Laura herself, exaggerated sentiment, and complete disregard for the feelings of others. Havoc inevitably ensues. This is Jane Austen retold but retaining her huge capacity for laughter and enjoyment of the absurd.

Except for one thing. The accused man says: You got the wrong guy. Then he says: Get Reacher for me. And sure enough, from the world he lives in—no phone, no address, no commitments–ex–military investigator Jack Reacher is coming. In Lee Child’s astonishing new thriller, Reacher’s arrival will change everything—about a case that isn’t what it seems, about lives tangled in baffling ways, about a killer who missed one shot–and by doing so give Jack Reacher one shot at the truth.…<br /><br />The gunman worked from a parking structure just thirty yards away–point-blank range for a trained military sniper like James Barr. His victims were in the wrong place at the wrong time. But why does Barr want Reacher at his side? There are good reasons why Reacher is the last person Barr would want to see. But when Reacher hears Barr’s own words, he understands. And a slam-dunk case explodes. Soon Reacher is teamed with a young defense lawyer who is working against her D.A. father and dueling with a prosecution team that has an explosive secret of its own. Like most things Reacher has known in life, this case is a complex battlefield. But, as always, in battle, Reacher is at his best.<br /><br />Moving in the shadows, picking his spots, Reacher gets closer and closer to the unseen enemy who is pulling the strings.

While <i>Mansfield Park</i> appears in some ways to continue where <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> left off, it is, as Kathryn Sutherland shows in her illuminating Introduction, a much darker work, which challenges 'the very values (of tradition, stability, retirement and faithfulness) it appears to endorse'.

Eight years before the story proper begins, she is happily betrothed to a naval officer, Frederick Wentworth, but she precipitously breaks off the engagement when persuaded by her friend Lady Russell that such a match is unworthy. The breakup produces in Anne a deep and long-lasting regret. When later Wentworth returns from sea a rich and successful captain, he finds Anne's family on the brink of financial ruin and his own sister a tenant in Kellynch Hall, the Elliot estate. All the tension of the novel revolves around one question: Will Anne and Wentworth be reunited in their love?<br /><br />Jane Austen once compared her writing to painting on a little bit of ivory, 2 inches square. Readers of <i>Persuasion</i> will discover that neither her skill for delicate, ironic observations on social custom, love, and marriage nor her ability to apply a sharp focus lens to English manners and morals has deserted her in her final finished work.",4.14,5:212323|4:157266|3:82924|2:18794|1:8940|total:480247,431234,11004,249,Oxford University Press,eng,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,0192802631,9780192802637,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2156.Persuasion

Meanwhile Elinor, always sensitive to social convention, is struggling to conceal her own romantic disappointment, even from those closest to her.

22965,7550698,Ten Thousand Miles with a Dog Sled: A Narrative of Winter Travel in Interior Alaska,Hudson Stuck,"Though born and raised in England, explorer HUDSON STUCK (1865-1920) epitomized the adventurous New World spirit of the American West at its closing. Drawn by the wide-open spaces, Stuck, an Episcopal priest and champion of ""muscular Christianity,"" volunteered in 1904 to serve as the archdeacon of the Yukon; his spiritual domain encompassed 250,000 square miles of interior Alaska. In this dramatic 1914 work, Stuck draws upon his eight years of continuous travels in this ""great, wild country"" to paint an exhilarating portrait of a rugged land and the people who lived there. This is no mild tale of priestly ministering or zealous missionary work-Stuck all but eschews discussion of his actual work to regale us with tales of the ""gentle aboriginal population"" and ""some of the hardiest and most adventurous white men in the world,"" and warns against ""low-down whites"" with no respect for native culture or the sanctity of the land. With this beautiful and untamed land again threatened by encroaching development, this century-old book remains a fresh and vital read.

Cuando llega a la carretera, advirtió al intendente que iba unos cien pasos delante de ella. Esto la alegra porque no habia visto a Marta desde hacía una semana.

The Zeppelin which was ""winged"" while flying over Kent last week has not yet been found, and is believed to be still in hiding in the densely wooded country between Maidstone and Ashford. Confirmation of this report is supplied by a local farmer, who states that on three successive nights the cat's supper has been stolen from his scullery steps. This strange circumstance, considered in the light of the Germans' inordinate passion for cats' meat, has gone far to satisfy the authorities that the capture of the crippled monster is only a question of time. Mr. William Aird, in a lecture upon ""Health, Disease and Economical Living,"" insisted that we should all be much healthier if we lived on ""rabbit food."" Possibly; but the vital question is-would not this diet induce in us a tendency to become conscientious objectors? ""It is most necessary,"" stated a Manchester economics expert last week, ""that the Government should release more beef for civilian needs.""

He originally put forth his idea in the essay ""The Significance of the Frontier in American History,"" published just three years after the frontier was ""officially closed"" in 1890. He continued to elaborate on the frontier thesis as well as the influence of sectionalism, and the unique contributions of the Midwest to American democracy.

She was there to photograph the artifacts collected by a highly secretive organization, founded two centuries earlier by an alchemist. And the alchemist's descendant-her employer, Gabriel Jones-has the eyes of a sorcerer.<br /><br />But despite Venetia's intent to seduce Mr. Jones and move on, she is shattered upon her return home to read in the press of his violent demise. Using the sizable fee Mr. Jones paid her, Venetia establishes a new life, opening a gallery in London. Of course, posing as a respectable widow makes it easier to do business, so-in a private tribute to her lost, only lover-she assumes the identity of ""Mrs. Jones.""<br /><br />Her romantic whim, however, will cause unexpected trouble. For one thing, Mr. Jones is about to stride, living and breathing, back into Venetia's life. And the two share more than a passionate memory-indeed, they are bonded by a highly unusual sort of vision, one that goes far beyond Venetia's abilities as a photographer. They also share a terrible threat-for someone has stolen a centuries-old notebook from Arcane House that contains a formula believed to enhance psychic powers of the kind Gabriel and Venetia possess. And the thief wants to know more-even if he must kill the keeper of the Arcane Society's treasures, or the photographer who catalogued them, to obtain such knowledge.",3.85,5:3475|4:4684|3:3484|2:672|1:165|total:12480,11210,501,338,Jove Books,eng,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,0515142808,9780515142808,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/155659.Second_Sight

23051,21242602,The Two Shipmates,W.H.G. Kingston,"The stout trading brig Amity, Samuel Mudge master and part owner, was gliding up Plymouth Sound on a summer's evening towards her accustomed berth in Catwater, a few years before the termination of the last war between England and France. She had no pilot on board; indeed, her crew averred that the old craft could find the way in and out of the harbour by herself; at all events, her master knew it better than most men trading from the port, as did his young mate, Ralph Michelmore. The last rays of the setting sun were glancing on the topgallant mast-heads of the brig when her anchor was dropped, and by the time her sails were furled and all was made snug the gloom of night had settled down on the Pool, and twinkling lights began to appear from the houses on shore. ""You'll be wishing to go on shore, my boy,"" said the old master, as Ralph, the duties for the day over, came into the cabin to join him at tea, which the boy had just placed on the table. ""There'll be some one who'll be right glad to see thee, lad;"" and the speaker looked up at the mate, whose handsome countenance beamed with pleasure, a slight blush rising on it as he answered- ""Thank you, sir; thank you heartily. I should very much like to pay Mistress Treviss-and-and her granddaughter a visit. I had few opportunities of seeing them when we were last in port, and as we have been long on this trip they may be anxious about us. But would not you prefer going on shore yourself, captain? It's my duty to remain on board.""",4.00,5:0|4:1|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:1,1,0,,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21242602-the-two-shipmates

But the craggy, homely old Dean, lived locked in by shyness... when an obscure watchmaker, the timid, fearful little Isaac Peabody, a genius of a clockmaker, strikes up an unlikely friendship with the Dean. It leads to an unusual spiritual awakening in both men, and this unexpected friendship of these two men; also leads the Dean's remarkable awakening to the healing force of unselfish love; and the miracles wrought as he reached out to other human hearts to console them. It eventually reaches out to the entire community. And in the background there are Polly and her beloved Job, Bella and old Mrs Montague.",4.42,5:621|4:319|3:111|2:21|1:4|total:1076,830,121,383,Servant Publications,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1259321700l/205636._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1259321700l/205636._SY75_.jpg,0892837004,9780892837007,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/205636.The_Dean_s_Watch

23060,817790,The Unknown Masterpiece,Honoré de Balzac,"One of Honore de Balzac's most celebrated tales, ""The Unknown Masterpiece"" is the story of a painter who, depending on one's perspective, is either an abject failure or a transcendental genius--or both. The story, which has served as an inspiration to artists as various as Cezanne, Henry James, Picasso, and New Wave director Jacques Rivette, is, in critic Dore Ashton's words, a ""fable of modern art."" Published here in a new translation by poet Richard Howard, ""The Unknown Masterpiece"" appears, as Balzac intended, with ""Gambara,"" a grotesque and tragic novella about a musician undone by his dreams.<br /><br />Honoré De Balzac (1799-1850) is generally credited as the inventor of the modern realistic novel. In more than ninety novels, he set forth French society and life as he saw it. He created a cast of over two thousand individual and identifiable characters, some of whom reappear in different novels. He organized his works into his masterpiece, <i>La Comedie Humaine,</i>which was the final result of his attempt to grasp the whole of society and experience into one varied but unified work.<br /><br />Richard Howard was born in Cleveland in 1929. He is the author of fourteen volumes of poetry and has published more than one hundred fifty translations from the French, including works by Gide, Stendhal, de Beauvoir, Baudelaire, and de Gaulle. Howard received a National Book Award for his translation of <i>Fleurs du mal</i> and a Pulitzer Prize for <i>Untitled Subjects</i>, a collection of poetry.",3.87,5:709|4:979|3:670|2:145|1:23|total:2526,1534,99,160,NYRB Classics,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320554759l/817790._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320554759l/817790._SY75_.jpg,0940322749,9780940322745,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/817790.The_Unknown_Masterpiece

After his initial and tentative diagnosis, Gibson suspended her writing for two years; but then poetry returned, and the creative process became the lightning rod that grounded her and presented a path forward. The poems in Broken Cup bear witness to how Alzheimer's erodes memory and cognitive function, but they never forget to see what is present and to ask what may remain of the self. Moving and unflinchingly honest in the acknowledgment of pain, frustration, and grief, the poems uncover, time and time again, the grace of abiding love. Gibson gives heart as well as voice to an experience that is deeply personal, yet shared by all too many.",4.61,5:12|4:5|3:1|2:0|1:0|total:18,18,5,77,LSU Press,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1410133523l/20786382._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1410133523l/20786382._SX50_.jpg,0807156426,9780807156421,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20786382-broken-cup

Both are now adults; life’s great discoveries have been made, its vagaries and losses have been suffered. Through it all, the women’s friendship has remained the gravitational center of their lives. <br /><br />Both women once fought to escape the neighborhood in which they grew up—a prison of conformity, violence, and inviolable taboos. Elena married, moved to Florence, started a family, and published several well-received books. In this final book, she has returned to Naples. Lila, on the other hand, never succeeded in freeing herself from the city of her birth. She has become a successful entrepreneur, but her success draws her into closer proximity with the nepotism, chauvinism, and criminal violence that infect her neighborhood. Proximity to the world she has always rejected only brings her role as its unacknowledged leader into relief. For Lila is unstoppable, unmanageable, unforgettable!<br /><br />Against the backdrop of a Naples that is as seductive as it is perilous and a world undergoing epochal change, the story of a lifelong friendship is told with unmatched honesty and brilliance. The four volumes in this series constitute a long remarkable story that readers will return to again and again, and every return will bring with it new revelations.",4.39,5:34000|4:21089|3:6456|2:1074|1:308|total:62927,41469,3546,480,Europa Editions,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1499781984l/25242224._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1499781984l/25242224._SY75_.jpg,1609452860,9781609452865,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25242224-the-story-of-the-lost-child

Schultz and S. T. Joshi’s exhaustive investigation into the book’s writing and publishing history. All of Bierce’s known satiric definitions are here, including previously uncollected, unpublished, and alternative entries. Definitions dropped from previous editions have been restored while nearly two hundred wrongly attributed to Bierce have been excised. For dedicated Bierce readers, an introduction and notes are also included.<br /><br />Ambrose Bierce’s Devil’s Dictionary is a classic that stands alongside the best work of satirists such as Twain, Mencken, and Thurber.

Then why funk a General Election? Some people have such a nasty way of putting things! Liberal gentleman to Unionist gentleman: ""Well, have you taken the pledge?"" Attempts are now being made to establish penny postage between England and France. The Germans are said to feel flattered that we should still consider the privilege of corresponding with them worth two-pence-halfpenny. The public indignation against the woman who damaged the ""Rokeby Venus"" continues unabated, and most inhuman propositions are being made. One gentleman has even been heard to suggest that the woman ought to be made to serve her term of imprisonment in the Royal Academy. General Villa's statement that, unless the ransom he demands is paid at once, he will expose the body of the son of General Terrazas to the fire of the Federals confirms the opinion prevalent in this country that General Villa is not really a very nice man.

Titanic: Its Story and Its Lessons,Lawrence Beesley,"First published in 1912, just two short months after the sinking of the TITANIC, this hauntingly immediate account opens with Lawrence Beesley's story of arriving onshore and soon after walking through the doors of Messrs. Houghton and Mifflin to tell his tale. THE LOSS OF THE S.S. TITANIC represents Beesley's attempt not just to record the events of the sinking but to set the record straight. In so doing, he captures both the majesty and the tragedy of this legendary voyage -- the view from the lifeboat as well as that from the deck. Full of wonderful nautical detail and written with a hair-raising clarity, THE LOSS OF THE S.S.

23101,19074866,Three Thousand Years of Mental Healing,George Barton Cutten,"""Mental healing"" emphasizes the interpenetration of what are usually called ""mind"" and ""body"" and makes use of the power of thought to affect the body. In the worldview of mental healing, people's deeply-held thoughts make them ill or at least create the preconditions for disease and psychological problems. Healers work to remove deeply held resentments, to release unexpressed emotions, to assuage buried terror (all of which, in this view, are caused by deeply held thoughts), in order to build self-confidence and to plant in people a positive and hopeful view of their path through life. Mental healers insist that, just as people can make themselves sick by the way they think, the way they think can make them well again. On a simple level, a person whose self-image has led to a destructive diet that has caused medical problems may improve the problem and the diet by changing the self-image--which is a way of thinking, an intention, a mental act. Psychologists teach people to improve depression by changing the way they think. But mental healing travels further out the continuum occupied by these easily accepted cases, to claim that all disease is caused by how we use our minds and can be improved by using our minds differently. Mental healing departs even more radically from the normal view when it holds that thoughts can change not only the body, but even the external world. Energy-based healing methods rarely seem to employ mental activities--except for some visualizations. In energy systems, thinking is more likely to be considered part of the problem and pre-cognitive energy flow the solution. In mental healing, thinking is both problem and cure.",3.83,5:4|4:0|3:0|2:1|1:1|total:6,6,0,,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19074866-three-thousand-years-of-mental-healing

  <i>As the vastly advanced guardians of mankind, the Belphins knew how to make a lesson stick-but whom?-</i>
</strong><em>opening to story:</em><strong>-</strong>Ludovick Eversole sat in the golden sunshine outside his house, writing a poem as he watched the street flow gently past him. There were very few people on it, for he lived in a slow part of town, and those who went in for travel generally preferred streets where the pace was quicker.Moreover, on a sultry spring afternoon like this one, there would be few people wandering abroad. Most would be lying on sun-kissed white beaches or in sun-drenched parks, or, for those who did not fancy being either kissed or drenched by the sun, basking in the comfort of their own air-conditioned villas.Some would, like Ludovick, be writing poems; others composing symphonies; still others painting pictures. Those who were without creative talent or the inclination to indulge it would be relaxing their well-kept golden bodies in whatever surroundings they had chosen to spend this particular one of the perfect days that stretched in an unbroken line before every member of the human race from the cradle to the crematorium. <p></p> <p>Only the Belphins were much in evidence. Only the Belphins had duties to perform. Only the Belphins worked. </p> <p>Ludovick stretched his own well-kept golden body and rejoiced in the knowing that he was a man and not a Belphin. Immediately afterward, he was sorry for the heartless thought. Didn't the Belphins work only to serve humanity? How ungrateful, then, it was to gloat over them! Besides, he comforted himself, probably, if the truth were known, the Belphins <i>liked </i>to work. He hailed a passing Belphin for assurance on this point. </p> <p>Courteous, like all members of his species, the creature leaped from the street and listened attentively to the young man's question. ""We Belphins have but one like and one dislike,"" he replied. ""We like what is right and we dislike what is wrong."" </p> <p>""But how can you tell what is right and what is wrong?"" Ludovick persisted. </p> <p>""We <i>know</i>,"" the Belphin said, gazing reverently across the city to the blue spire of the tower where The Belphin of Belphins dwelt, in constant communication with every member of his race at all times, or so they said. ""That is why we were placed in charge of humanity. Someday you, too, may advance to the point where you <i>know</i>, and we shall return whence we came."" </p> <p>""But <i>who </i>placed you in charge,"" Ludovick asked, ""and whence <i>did </i>you come?"" Fearing he might seem motivated by vulgar curiosity, he explained, ""I am doing research for an epic poem."" </p>",3.16,5:5|4:18|3:25|2:12|1:3|total:63,36,5,,,eng,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6328984-the-blue-tower

23115,2726797,The Billow and the Rock,Harriet Martineau,"Excerpt from The Billow and the Rock: A Tale <br />Scotland was a strange and uncomfortable country to live in a hundred years ago. Strange beyond measure its state of society appears to us when we consider, not only that it was called a Christian country, but that the people had shown that they really did care very much for their religion, and were bent upon worshipping God according to their conscience and true belief. While earnest in their religion, their state of society was yet very wicked: a thing which usually happens when a whole people are passing from one way of living and being governed to another. Scotland had not long been united with England. While the wisest of the nation saw that the only hope for the country was in being governed by the same king and parliament as the English, many of the most powerful men wished not to be governed at all, but to be altogether despotic over their dependents and neighbours, and to have their own way in everything.",3.00,5:0|4:0|3:2|2:0|1:0|total:2,2,1,192,Dodo Press,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1406587729,9781406587722,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2726797-the-billow-and-the-rock

The hired man, Ben, reports that a tramp came through the area earlier in the day and that the man quoted poetry. Ruth and Tom suspect that the man might be an actor who realized the value of the scenario.<br /><br />Soon, Ruth joins Mr. Hammond and his film company in Maine where they are making Ruth's latest film. Mr. Hammond is disappointed to learn that Ruth's scenario is missing and comments that he must search for another one to use. He offers five hundred dollars cash to anyone who can produce a usable script. Ruth reads some of the scripts that are submitted to Mr. Hammond and is shocked when she recognizes her story.<br />	<br />Tom cast aside his sweater and plunged into the tide.<br />Unfortunately, Ruth had been very secretive about the plot of her scenario, so she has no proof that the story is hers.

23119,41548499,A Forgotten Hero Not for Him: Large Print,Emily Sarah Holt,"A Forgotten Hero Not for Him by Emily Sarah Holt Clarice, with another courtesy and a murmur of thanks, took her seat in the recess of the window, where her mother was already sitting. For these two were mother and daughter; a middle-aged, comfortable-looking mother, with a mixture of firmness and good-nature in her face; and a daughter of some sixteen years, rather pale and slender, but active and intelligent in her appearance. Clarice's dark hair was smoothly brushed and turned up in a curl all round her head, being cut sufficiently short for that purpose. Her dress was long and loose, made in what we call the Princess style, with a long train, which she tucked under one arm when she walked. The upper sleeve was of a narrow bell shape, but under it came down tight ones to the wrist, fastened by a row of large round buttons quite up to the elbow. A large apron-which Clarice called a barm-cloth-protected the dress from stain. A fillet of ribbon was bound round her head, but she had no ornaments of any kind. Her mother wore a similar costume, excepting that in her case the fillet round the head was exchanged for a wimple, which was a close hood, covering head and neck, and leaving no part exposed but the face. It was a very comfortable article in cold weather, but an eminently unbecoming one.... We are delighted to publish this classic book as part of our extensive Classic Library collection. Many of the books in our collection have been out of print for decades, and therefore have not been accessible to the general public. The aim of our publishing program is to facilitate rapid access to this vast reservoir of literature, and our view is that this is a significant literary work, which deserves to be brought back into print after many decades.

For us no hotel shall spread its luxurious board; no road-side inn shall hang out its inviting sign and ""clean beds;"" no roof of any kind shall offer us its hospitable shelter.

In 1845, seven years after escaping to the North, he published Narrative, the first of three autobiographies. This book calmly but dramatically recounts the horrors and the accomplishments of his early years—the daily, casual brutality of the white masters; his painful efforts to educate himself; his decision to find freedom or die; and his harrowing but successful escape.<br /><br />An astonishing orator and a skillful writer, Douglass became a newspaper editor, a political activist, and an eloquent spokesperson for the civil rights of African Americans. He lived through the Civil War, the end of slavery, and the beginning of segregation. He was celebrated internationally as the leading black intellectual of his day, and his story still resonates in ours.",4.01,5:32933|4:27618|3:16010|2:4508|1:2380|total:83449,1056,132,160,Barnes  Noble Classics,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328753058l/91587._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328753058l/91587._SY75_.jpg,1593080417,9781593080419,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/91587.The_Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Frederick_Douglass_An_American_Slave

23141,295,Treasure Island,Robert Louis Stevenson,"""For sheer storytelling delight and pure adventure, <i>Treasure Island</i> has never been surpassed. From the moment young Jim Hawkins first encounters the sinister Blind Pew at the Admiral Benbow Inn until the climactic battle for treasure on a tropic isle, the novel creates scenes and characters that have fired the imaginations of generations of readers. Written by a superb prose stylist, a master of both action and atmosphere, the story centers upon the conflict between good and evil - but in this case a particularly engaging form of evil. It is the villainy of that most ambiguous rogue Long John Silver that sets the tempo of this tale of treachery, greed, and daring. Designed to forever kindle a dream of high romance and distant horizons, <i>Treasure Island</i> is, in the words of G. K. Chesterton, 'the realization of an ideal, that which is promised in its provocative and beckoning map; a vision not only of white skeletons but also green palm trees and sapphire seas.' G. S. Fraser terms it 'an utterly original book' and goes on to write: 'There will always be a place for stories like <i>Treasure Island</i> that can keep boys and old men happy.'",3.83,5:101694|4:135206|3:99894|2:22272|1:6571|total:365637,310066,6498,311,Kingfisher,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1485248909l/295._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1485248909l/295._SX50_.jpg,0753453800,9780753453803,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/295.Treasure_Island

23145,1077813,A Ilustre Casa de Ramires,Eça de Queirós,"Bem-vindo ao maravilhoso mundo de Eça de Queirós. Nesta edição clássica do seu romance A Ilustre Casa de Ramires, trazemos até si a melhor edição esta admirável peça literária do final do século XIX e início do século XX.<br /><br />A Ilustre Casa de Ramires é um romance realista da terceira fase do escritor português. Publicado em 1900, representa a sua maturidade intelectual e o apogeu do seu estilo como escritor, onde a crítica corrosiva e a ironia cáustica que haviam marcado a segunda etapa da sua produção – fase de adesão ao naturalismo – cedem lugar a uma postura de maior esperança nos valores humanos e abrem espaço para um certo optimismo.<br /><br />A história aparente narra a vida de Gonçalo Mendes Ramires, a sua chegada à política e as tradições familiares portuguesas, mas fica evidente a analogia que Eça de Queirós faz com a História portuguesa, as suas mudanças políticas e a sua tradição. <br /><br />Escrita e publicada em meio a instabilidade política da monarquia e sob a humilhação do Ultimato inglês, Eça de Queirós sugere um retorno ao colonialismo e à aristocracia como saída para Portugal.<br /><br />Esperamos que tenha tanto prazer a ler esta obra clássica quanto aquele que nós, Mogul Classics, tivemos a trazer-lha até si.(Edição Ilustrada): Com biografia do autor e índice activo",3.91,5:307|4:448|3:259|2:52|1:14|total:1080,791,24,312,Editorial Presença,por,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1270000479l/1077813._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1270000479l/1077813._SY75_.jpg,0704301997,9780704301993,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1077813.A_Ilustre_Casa_de_Ramires

23159,15719105,Stairway to the Stars,Barbara Bickmore,"I am so happy to be introducing my latest book, “Stairway to the Stars,” as a digital book. Though this is the first time it’s been published in America, it has been a best seller in Germany for the last five years. It’s become one of my favorites.<br /><br /><br />It’s the story of Alexandra Curran, a girl born into unbelievable wealth and social prestige in the early part of the twentieth century. Her socially conscious mother wants the one thing America can’t offer. Royalty. So she manages to talk Alex into a loveless marriage with a young British duke who needs money, not only to refurbish the once famous Castle Carlisle, but to live in a lifestyle that impresses the older woman he loves.<br /><br /><br />Based in great part on the history of the times and of life in England between the two World Wars, this is the sprawling story of a woman who will make a difference to the whole world and will find fulfillment in ways of which she has never dreamt.<br /><br /><br />This is the story of how a seemingly defeated woman can take hold of life and raise herself and those around her to heroic actions, of how she awakens love in those who thought themselves without love.<br /><br /><br />Yet it is the story of any woman, of a woman who can take charge of her own life when she sees little hope, and carves out for herself a life that affects others, even those thousands whom she never sees. Though there is pain and regret, a sense of hopelessness and despair, Alex – little by little – reaches out for help and to help, and grows as a result to find a life of reward and hope.",3.91,5:18|4:18|3:14|2:3|1:1|total:54,31,4,489,Smashwords Edition,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1340483913l/15719105._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1340483913l/15719105._SY75_.jpg,,9781465997777,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15719105-stairway-to-the-stars

23164,7042379,The Creature from Cleveland Depths,Fritz Leiber,"Fritz Leiber's ""The Creature from Cleveland Depths"" might have sounded far-fetched fifty years ago -- a comic warning about people being bossed around by little machines that ride on their shoulders. But now, it seems to describe the real world of cell phones, Blackberries and iPods, and its prediction of terrible things to come isn't so easy to shrug off. Leiber sets the tale in a future when ""missiles are on the prowl,"" and most people live underground. George Gusterson is a writer with crazy ideas -- one being, he still lives on the surface. For another, he imagines a gizmo that would remind him of things like when to turn on the TV. George's mere whim inspires an actual gadget called the Tickler, just a ""wire recorder and clock"" at first, but then . . . it whispers constantly through an earphone. It instills positive thinking. It injects drugs. It makes decisions. It weights 28 pounds. And it won't get off. Only Gusterson understands what ""the little fellow perched on your shoulder"" is really saying, one word: <i>Obey!</i> And only Gusterson knows what to say back, if it's not too late.",3.66,5:22|4:50|3:31|2:11|1:3|total:117,74,15,76,Aegypan,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1606642863,9781606642863,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7042379-the-creature-from-cleveland-depths

While he was in college he had shown an aptitude for writing verse, and two of his poems—""Loch Ine"" and ""Irish Castles""—were published in <i>The Ballads of Ireland</i> (1856). His earliest writings in the United States were contributed to <i>The Lantern</i>. Subsequently he wrote for <i>The Home Journal</i>, <i>The New York Times</i>, and <i>The American Whig Review</i>. His first important literary connection was with <i>Harper's Magazine</i>, and beginning in February 1853 with <i>The Two Skulls</i>, he contributed more than sixty articles in prose and verse to that periodical. He likewise wrote for the <i>New York Saturday Press</i> and <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i>. To the latter he sent ""The Diamond Lens"" (1858) and ""The Wondersmith"" (1859), which are unsurpassed as creations of the imagination, and are unique among short magazine stories.

23174,34011407,Doctor Thorne (1876) Novel by: Anthony Trollope,Anthony Trollope,"Doctor Thorne (1858) is the third novel in Anthony Trollope's series known as the Chronicles of Barsetshire. The idea of the plot was suggested to Trollope by his brother Thomas. It is mainly concerned with the romantic problems of Mary Thorne, niece of Doctor Thomas Thorne (a member of a junior branch of the family of Mr Wilfred Thorne, who appeared in Barchester Towers), and Frank Gresham, the only son of the local squire, although Trollope as the omniscient narrator assures the reader at the beginning that the hero is really the doctor. Themes of the book are the social pain and exclusion caused by illegitimacy, the nefarious effects of the demon drink and the difficulties of romantic attachments outside one's social class. The novel also gives a vivid picture of electioneering and all the barely legal shenanigans that accompany the event. Most of the action takes place in a village of Barsetshire and a country house not far off.",4.09,5:1893|4:2146|3:954|2:160|1:46|total:5199,0,0,356,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,154258082X,9781542580823,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34011407-doctor-thorne-1876-novel-by

A relatively short, tongue-in-cheek tale that can be read in one sitting, the story is that of likeable, well-built man of royal lineage, a huge heart, and a bad case of wanderlust. With the ability to play seven instruments without an instrument, to wrap the hearts of children around him in an instant, and to do the work of three men, ""Tom"" was a likeable fellow indead. He just didn't like to stay in one place or in one job very long, and he never revealed his royal connections--that is, until he met Isobel.

23182,3205860,Baghdad at Sunrise: A Brigade Commander's War in Iraq,Peter R. Mansoor,"This compelling book presents an unparalleled record of what happened after U.S. forces seized Baghdad in the spring of 2003. Army Colonel Peter R. Mansoor, the on-the-ground commander of the 1st Brigade, 1st Armored Division—the “Ready First Combat Team”—describes his brigade’s first year in Iraq, from the sweltering, chaotic summer after the Ba’athists’ defeat to the transfer of sovereignty to an interim Iraqi government a year later. Uniquely positioned to observe, record, and assess the events of that fateful year, Mansoor now explains what went right and wrong as the U.S. military confronted an insurgency of unexpected strength and tenacity.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Drawing not only on his own daily combat journal but also on observations by embedded reporters, news reports, combat logs, archived e-mails, and many other sources, Mansoor offers a contemporary record of the valor, motivations, and resolve of the 1st Brigade and its attachments during Operation Iraqi Freedom. Yet this book has a deeper significance than a personal memoir or unit history. <i>Baghdad at Sunrise</i> provides a detailed, nuanced analysis of U.S. counterinsurgency operations in Iraq, and along with it critically important lessons for America’s military and political leaders of the twenty-first century.<br /><br />",3.92,5:43|4:47|3:34|2:7|1:2|total:133,114,9,376,Yale University Press,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1346212821l/3205860._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1346212821l/3205860._SX50_.jpg,030014069X,9780300140699,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3205860-baghdad-at-sunrise

Playing off the book’s title, Manning demonstrates that no one is common or simple. Instead, he creates a detailed, complex, and poignant portrait—by turns serious and hilarious, philosophical and speculative, but ultimately tragic—of a fast-disappearing aspect of American culture. <i>The Common Man</i>’s accessibility and its enthusiastic and sincere charms make it the perfect antidote to the glib ironies that characterize much contemporary American verse.

23196,12309143,Songs for a Little House,Christopher  Morley,"Christopher Morley (1890-1957) was an American journalist, novelist, essayist and poet. He went to New College, Oxford University for three years on a Rhodes Scholarship, studying modern history. He moved to Philadelphia where he got his start as a newspaper reporter and then columnist for various publications. In 1920, he returned to New York City and took a job writing the column The Bowling Green for the New York Evening Post. He was one of the founders and long-time contributing editor of the Saturday Review of Literature. Out of enthusiasm for the Sherlock Holmes stories, he became the founder of the Baker Street Irregulars and wrote the introduction to the standard omnibus edition of The Complete Sherlock Holmes. Author of more than 100 books of essays, poetry, and novels, he is probably best known as the author of Kitty Foyle (1939), which was made into an Academy Award-winning movie. His works include Parnassus on Wheels (1917), Shandygaff (1918), The Haunted Bookshop (1919), Where the Blue Begins (1922), Thunder on the Left (1925), The Trojan Horse (1937), and The Old Mandarin (1947).",3.40,5:1|4:1|3:2|2:1|1:0|total:5,4,2,,,en-US,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12309143-songs-for-a-little-house

If a painter had ever strayed to our uninteresting little town he would certainly have put old Mahlmann's characteristic head on his canvas. He had a clever old face with a firm mouth and glittering eyes whose expression was so sombre and at the same time observant that we children imagined old Mahlmann was different from other people. And indeed so he was. To begin with he never thanked anyone for bringing him food; in fact he criticized freely the benefits he received. If one brought what was not to his liking, he would say: ""Go home and tell your mother old Mahlmann is not a waste-tub where you throw what's not fit to eat.

And as we some times seek rest from the brilliant audacities and complex passions of Wagner or Tschaikowsky in the tender simplicity of some ancient English air, so we occasionally turn with relief from the wit and insight and subtlety of our modern novelists to the old uncomplicated tales of faerie or romance, and find them after all more moving, more tender, even more real, than all the laboured realism of these photographic days. And here before us is of all pretty love-stories perhaps the prettiest.

23228,8099195,Arabische Nächte,Hans Bethge,"Hans Bethge (1876-1946) war ein deutscher Dichter und machte sich vor allem einen Namen durch seine Nachdichtungen orientalischer Lyrik. Hans Bethge studierte neuere Sprachen und Philosophie in Halle, Erlangen und Genf. Nach der Promotion arbeitete er zwei Jahre in Spanien als Lehrer. 1901 lie er sich als freier Schriftsteller in Berlin nieder. Bethge verffentlichte mehrere Gedichtbnde (hauptschlich Liebes- und Naturlyrik), Tagebcher, Reiseberichte, Erzhlungen, Essays und Dramen.

23237,34043643,The Last Mrs. Parrish,Liv Constantine,"Amber Patterson is fed up. She’s tired of being a nobody: a plain, invisible woman who blends into the background. She deserves more—a life of money and power like the one blond-haired, blue-eyed goddess Daphne Parrish takes for granted.<br /><br />To everyone in the exclusive town of Bishops Harbor, Connecticut, Daphne—a socialite and philanthropist—and her real-estate mogul husband, Jackson, are a couple straight out of a fairy tale.<br /><br />Amber’s envy could eat her alive . . . if she didn't have a plan. Amber uses Daphne’s compassion and caring to insinuate herself into the family’s life—the first step in a meticulous scheme to undermine her. Before long, Amber is Daphne’s closest confidante, traveling to Europe with the Parrishes and their lovely young daughters, and growing closer to Jackson. But a skeleton from her past may undermine everything that Amber has worked towards, and if it is discovered, her well-laid plan may fall to pieces. <br /><br />With shocking turns and dark secrets that will keep you guessing until the very end, <em>The Last Mrs. Parrish</em> is a fresh, juicy, and utterly addictive thriller from a diabolically imaginative talent.",3.88,5:23004|4:30660|3:16820|2:4934|1:1878|total:77296,54578,5846,560,HarperLuxe,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1486501028l/34043643._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1486501028l/34043643._SY75_.jpg,0062688162,9780062688163,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34043643-the-last-mrs-parrish

23258,9012918,"Journal of Jasper Danckaerts, 1679-1680",Jasper Danckaerts,"In 1679 and again in 1683, Dutchman JASPER DANCKAERTS (b. 1639) journeyed twice to the New World, with companion Peter Sluyter, on behalf of their Labadist Protestant community, in search of a suitable place to establish a colony of their sect. Danckaerts's diary of the voyages was lost until American historian HENRY C. MURPHY (1810-1882) stumbled across the manuscript in a bookstore in Amsterdam. Murphy's translation forms the basis for the 1913 edition of Danckaerts's journal, of which this is a replica. Edited by American historians BARTLETT BURLEIGH JAMES (1867-1953) and J. FRANKLIN JAMESON (1859-1937), this is an extraordinary firsthand document of the settling of colonial America, and of an obscure, mostly forgotten episode in the religious history of the New World. Replete with closely observed details of ocean travel and social conditions in New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, and Boston, it makes for a delightful read for lovers of 17th-century colonial America.",3.33,5:0|4:2|3:4|2:0|1:0|total:6,3,0,352,Cosimo Classics,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1616401826,9781616401825,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9012918-journal-of-jasper-danckaerts-1679-1680

The last chapter is headed ""Historical Appendix"", and contains potted lives of most of the people whom we meet in the book, since the majority of them really existed. Of course the detail of the conversations in the book is made up, but we can well believe that something very like them might well have happened. What is very evident is that many of these people were plotters, the object of their desires being in some way to increase their own wealth or status. Even small children may be imprisoned and murdered, as we remember from the sad tale of ""the Princes in the Tower"".If you are fond of reading historical novels, and are familiar with the general history of the fifteenth century, you will enjoy this view of the lives of the figures that made that history.",3.50,5:0|4:1|3:1|2:0|1:0|total:2,0,0,,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,9781554851768,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18956128-the-white-rose-of-langley

23279,385185,Le Silence de la mer,Vercors,"Les Éditions de Minuit ont été conçues par Vercors à l'automne 1941 et créées par lui avec Pierre de Lescure. <i>Le Silence de la mer</i> (1942) est le premier titre à y être publié. Une vingtaine d'autres suivront jusqu'à la Libération, mais c'est le texte inaugural de Vercors qui connaît le plus grand retentissement. Cette sobre histoire, où une famille française s'oppose par le silence à l'officier allemand qu'elle a été obligée de loger, est un plaidoyer implacable contre la barbarie hitlérienne. Sous la calme surface des eaux, c'est la terrible « mêlée des bêtes dans la mer » qui se trouve soudain révélée, et toute « la vie sous-marine des sentiments cachés, des désirs et des pensées qui se nient et qui luttent ».<br />Les récits qui accompagnent ici <i>Le Silence de la mer</i> ont une portée peut-être moins complexe mais tout aussi forte.

Purchasers can usually download a free scanned copy of the original book (without typos) from the publisher. Not indexed. Not illustrated. 1848 edition. Excerpt: ...both blood and marks; for, however that old right for a man to chastise his wife is repudiated in the other parts of society, in this refined agr, yet in these walks of life, this ancient custom still holds good. Here a man is considered perfectly in the right to match his strength of arm against his wife's strength of tongue. The fellow hammered away at his helpless helpmate with hard words and harder blows, threatening all the time a separation, and extolling to their skies the beauties and perfections of another nymph, whom he swore he would join. Just at this moment the lady in question made her appearance; and, certainly, as far as personal looks, dress, and a mere sober demeanour went, she was superior to the one in possession. The wife, who had borne beneath the weighty power of her husband, in as becoming a manner as a wife ought to do, now felt as if endowed with the nervous locks of Sampson; fired with jealousy, and backed by Old Tom (gin), she sprung upon her rival, and, in a moment, ribbons, caps, and hair, were twisted in the clenched hand. Down went'a table and one or two forms, --men, women, and children, --and up rose yells, screams, and oaths, with all the stormy joys of fight seconding the uproar. Old Ben rushed in, and did his utmost to restore order, but it was "" no go,"" as they would say--family affairs must be settled. The Amazons tugged and tore at each other, if not with the fury and hate of bull-dogs, at least like their mates. The wife had secured the sweetheart by the hair, and was taking a most merciless advantage, by keeping her down.upon the floor, when a Scotch sailor, wishing, we suppose, to see a stand-up affair, unloosed her hold, and let the other escape. But Sawney had, at this time at least...",0.00,5:0|4:0|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:0,0,0,30,Theclassics.Us,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1230372059,9781230372051,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20275240-sinks-of-london-laid-open-a-pocket-companion-for-the-uninitiated-to-wh

Moments like that happen only in fairy tales.<br /><br />One year and one bad relationship later, his disbelief in love-at-first-sight is stripped away the day he meets Six: a girl with a strange name and an even stranger personality.

23327,7939797,Lodusky,Frances Hodgson Burnett,"Frances Hodgson Burnett (1849-1924) was an English- American playwright and author. She was best known for her children's stories, in particular The Secret Garden (1911) and Little Lord Fauntleroy (1886). Her first story was published in Godey's Lady's Book in 1868. Her main writing talent was combining realistic detail of workingclass life with a romantic plot. Her first novel was published in 1877; That Lass o' Lowrie's was a story of Lancashire life. After moving to Washington, D.C., Burnett wrote the novels Haworth's (1879), Louisiana (1880), A Fair Barbarian (1881), and Through One Administration (1883), as well as a play, Esmeralda (1881), written with William Gillette. Her later works include Sara Crewe, or, What Happened at Miss Minchin's (1888) - later rewritten as A Little Princess (1905); and A Lady of Quality (1896) - considered one of the best of her plays. The Lost Prince was published in 1915, and The Head of the House of Coombe was published in Canada in 1922. During World War I, Burnett put her beliefs about what happens after death into writing with her novella The White People (1917).",2.56,5:1|4:2|3:4|2:10|1:1|total:18,11,3,56,Dodo Press,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1406580333,9781406580334,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7939797-lodusky

In “Human Moments in World War III,” two men orbiting the earth, charged with gathering intelligence and reporting to Colorado Command, hear the voices of American radio, from a half century earlier. In the title story, Sisters Edgar and Grace, nuns working the violent streets of the South Bronx, confirm the neighborhood’s miracle, the apparition of a dead child, Esmeralda. <br /><br />Nuns, astronauts, athletes, terrorists and travelers, the characters in <i>The Angel Esmeralda </i>propel themselves into the world and define it. DeLillo’s sentences are instantly recognizable, as original as the splatter of Jackson Pollock or the luminous rectangles of Mark Rothko.

Cedric Errol is a generous, kind, and exemplary middle-class American boy who is suddenly found to be the heir of the Earl of Dorincourt. Saying loving goodbyes to his working-class friends, Cedric goes to England together with his mother to embrace his new fortune. His grandfather, the old earl, is a bitter old man ridden with gout and a foul temper, trusting no one. However the angelic boy elicits a profound transformation in the grandfather, which not only benefits the castle household but the whole populace of the earldom.<br /><br />If only the old man's heart would soften toward Cedric's estranged mother, the family would be healed at last. And when another potential heir to the earldom makes a claim, it seems that everything is lost....<br /><br />But all things are possible through a child's innocent trust, true friendship, and unconditional love.",3.84,5:5416|4:5704|3:4680|2:1229|1:356|total:17385,2,0,,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19080145-le-monsieur-de-la-petite-dame
23330,8339647,One Day At Arle,Frances Hodgson Burnett,"Frances Hodgson Burnett (1849-1924) was an English- American playwright and author. She was best known for her children's stories, in particular The Secret Garden (1911) and Little Lord Fauntleroy (1886). Her first story was published in Godey's Lady's Book in 1868. Her main writing talent was combining realistic detail of workingclass life with a romantic plot. Her first novel was published in 1877; That Lass o' Lowrie's was a story of Lancashire life. After moving to Washington, D.C., Burnett wrote the novels Haworth's (1879), Louisiana (1880), A Fair Barbarian (1881), and Through One Administration (1883), as well as a play, Esmeralda (1881), written with William Gillette. Her later works include Sara Crewe, or, What Happened at Miss Minchin's (1888) - later rewritten as A Little Princess (1905); and A Lady of Quality (1896) - considered one of the best of her plays. The Lost Prince was published in 1915, and The Head of the House of Coombe was published in Canada in 1922. During World War I, Burnett put her beliefs about what happens after death into writing with her novella The White People (1917).",2.96,5:5|4:1|3:8|2:8|1:2|total:24,11,1,,,eng,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8339647-one-day-at-arle

23345,11881486,A Gratidão,Camilo Castelo Branco,"Camilo Castelo Branco (1825-1890) foi um escritor portugu�s, considerado o criador da novela passional portuguesa. Escreveu irreverentes cr�nicas para jornais. Nasceu na freguesia dos M�rtires, em Lisboa, Portugal, ficou �rf�o de m�e com um ano e de pai com 10 anos. Foi morar com uma tia e depois com sua irm� mais velha. Em 1841, com apenas 16 anos, casou-se com uma jovem de 15 anos, Joaquina Pereira, mas logo a abandonou. Em 1843 ingressou na Escola M�dico-Cir�rgica na cidade do Porto, mas entregue � boemia, n�o conseguiu concluir o curso. Em 1845 publicou seus primeiros trabalhos liter�rios. Em 1846 fugiu com a jovem Patr�cia Em�lia, mas a abandona, poucos anos depois. No ano seguinte morreu sua esposa leg�tima, de quem estava separado, e a filha do casal morreu no ano seguinte. Camilo Castelo Branco passou por uma crise espiritual em 1850, e ingressou no semin�rio do Porto, pretendendo seguir a vida religiosa. Nesse ano conheceu Ana Pl�cido, que casada com um comerciante brasileiro, abandonou o marido em 1859 e foi viver com Camilo. Em 1860 � processado e preso por crime de adult�rio, mas � absolvido no ano seguinte, passando a viver com Ana. O casal foi morar em Lisboa e depois em S�o Miguel de Seide, sempre com muitos problemas financeiros. Em 1863 publica ""Amor de Perdi��o"", sua novela mais famosa. Sua vida atribulada lhe deu inspira��o para os temas de suas novelas. Tamb�m reconstituiu em suas obras o panorama dos costumes de Portugal de seu tempo, quase sempre com uma profunda sintonia com as maneiras de ser e sentir do povo portugu�s. Em 1889, quando se torna uma celebridade nacional como escritor, recebe uma homenagem da Academia de Lisboa. Recebeu o t�tulo de Visconde concedido pelo rei de Portugal, D. Lu�s I. Uma doen�a nos olhos que pouco a pouco lhe tirava a vis�o, fez Camilo mergulhar em profunda depress�o. Depois de saber que ficaria definitivamente cego Camilo suicida-se em S�o Miguel de Seide, Vila Nova de Famalic�o, no dia 01 de junho de 1890.",3.67,5:1|4:0|3:2|2:0|1:0|total:3,3,0,,Amazon Digital Services LLC,por,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11881486-a-gratid-o

The aim of these editions is to be as close as possible to Beatrix Potter's intentions while benefiting from modern printing and design techniques. <br />The colours and details of the watercolours in the volumes are reproduced more accurately than ever before, and it has now been possible to disguise damage that has affected the artwork over the years. Most notably, <i>The Tale of Peter Rabbit</i> restores six of Potter's original illustrations. Four were sacrificed in 1903 to make space for illustrated endpapers, and two have never been used before. Of course, Beatrix Potter created many memorable children's characters, including Benjamin Bunny, Tom Kitten, Jemima Puddle-duck and Jeremy Fisher.

23352,10796699,Comical People,J.J. Grandville,"Jean Ignace Isidore Gerard (1803-1847) was a French caricaturist, generally known by the pseudonym of J. J. Grandville. At the age of twenty-one he moved to Paris, where he published a collection of lithographs entitled Les Tribulations de la Petite Propriete. He followed this with Les Plaisirs de Toutdge and La Sibylle des Salons; but the work which first established his fame was Les Metamorphoses du Jour (1828-29), a series of seventy scenes in which individuals with the bodies of men and faces of animals are made to play a human comedy. He contributed to various periodicals, such as Le Silhouette, L'Artiste, La Caricature and Le Charivari. Thereafter his political caricatures which were characterized by marvelous fertility of satirical humour became very popular. After the reinstitution of prior censorship of caricature in 1835, he turned almost exclusively to book illustration, supplying illustrations for various standard works, such as The Songs of Beranger, The Fables of la Fontaine, Don Quixote, Gulliver's Travels and Robinson Crusoe. He also continued to issue various lithographic collections, among which may be mentioned La Vie Privee et Publique des Animaux, Les Cent Proverbes, L'Autre Monde and Les Fleurs Animees.",0.00,5:0|4:0|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:0,0,0,60,Dodo Press,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1406586293,9781406586299,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10796699-comical-people

But when a fall down a stairway onto a marble floor leaves him with a head injury, he is challenged with how to put the principles he'd been speaking about into practice.

23357,6162853,Miss Mehetabel's Son,Thomas Bailey Aldrich,"Thomas Bailey Aldrich (1836-1907) was an American poet, novelist, traveler, and editor. His father's death in 1849 compelled Aldrich to abandon the idea of college and he entered his uncle's business office in New York at age 16 in 1852. Here he soon became a constant contributor to the newspapers and magazines. From 1856 to 1859 he was on the staff of the Home Journal and during the Civil War was editor of the New York Illustrated News. Meanwhile Aldrich had written much, both in prose and verse. His genius was many-sided. His successive volumes of verse, chiefly The Ballad of Babie Bell (1856), Pampinea and Other Poems (1861), Cloth of Gold (1874), Flower and Thorn (1876), Friar Jerome's Beautiful Book (1881), Mercedes and Later Lyrics (1883), Wyndham Towers (1889), and the collected editions of 1865, 1882, 1897 and 1900, showed him to be a poet of lyrical skill, dainty touch and felicitous conceit, the influence of Herrick being constantly apparent.",3.00,5:0|4:0|3:1|2:0|1:0|total:1,1,0,48,Dodo Press,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1406551414,9781406551419,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6162853-miss-mehetabel-s-son

The sun streamed hot across the backs of the shining seats into her eyes, but she was too tired to get the window-pole. She watched the incoming class listlessly, wondering whether it would be worth while to ask one of them to close the shutter. They chattered and giggled and bustled in, rattling the chairs about, and begging one another's pardon vociferously, with that insistent politeness which marks a sharply defined stage in the social evolution of the young girl. They irritated her excessively-these little airs and graces. She opened her book with a snap, and began to call the roll sharply. Midway up the room sat a tall, dark girl, not handsome, but noticeably well dressed. She looked politely at her questioner when spoken to, but seemed as far in spirit as the distant trees toward which she directed her attention when not particularly addressed. She seemed to have a certain personality, a self-possession, a source of interest other than collegiate; and this held her apart from the others in the mind of the woman who sat before the desk.",0.00,5:0|4:0|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:0,0,0,26,Createspace,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,149538957X,9781495389573,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20833488-a-reversion-to-type

About the darkest hour of a very dark night, in the year 1883, a large brig lay becalmed on the Indian Ocean, not far from that region of the Eastern world which is associated in some minds with spices, volcanoes, coffee, and piratical junks, namely, the Malay Archipelago. Two men slowly paced the brig's quarterdeck for some time in silence, as if the elemental quietude which prevailed above and below had infected them. Both men were broad, and apparently strong. One of them was tall; the other short. More than this the feeble light of the binnacle-lamp failed to reveal. ""Father,"" said the tall man to the short one, ""I do like to hear the gentle pattering of the reef-points on the sails; it is so suggestive of peace and rest. Doesn't it strike you so?"" ""Can't say it does, lad,"" replied the short man, in a voice which, naturally mellow and hearty, had been rendered nautically harsh and gruff by years of persistent roaring in the teeth of wind and weather.

23428,1113155,The Conquest of Bread,Pyotr Kropotkin,"<br />The fourth in AK Press’ Working Classics series, <i>The Conquest of Bread</i> is Peter Kropotkin’s most extensive study of human needs and his outline of the most rational and equi-table means of satisfying them. A combination of detailed historical analysis and far-reaching utopian vision, this is a step-by-step guide to social revolution: the concrete means of achieving it, and the world that humanity’s “constructive genius” is capable of creating. Includes a new introduction that historically situates and discusses the contemporary relevance of Kropotkin’s ideas.",4.14,5:1351|4:1175|3:533|2:134|1:32|total:3225,2309,165,224,AK Press,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328694308l/1113155._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328694308l/1113155._SX50_.jpg,1904859100,9781904859109,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1113155.The_Conquest_of_Bread

23440,4075958,Edward Barry (South Sea Pearler),Louis Becke,"George Lewis Becke (1848-1913) was an Australian short-story writer and novelist. He began his voyages in the south seas at a very early age and there are two accounts of these beginnings: one by the Earl of Pembroke, who presumably obtained his information from Becke, which is prefixed to By Reef and Palm (1894), and the other written by Becke. It is difficult to reconcile them, and all that is certain is that Becke spent many years on vessels trading in the Pacific islands. Becke went to London, and he remained in Europe for about 15 years, during which time a large number of collections of short stories and a few novels and stories for boys were published. He was fairly paid by the magazines for his stories, but he always sold his books outright. About 30 of Becke's books are listed in Miller's Australian Literature with six other volumes written in collaboration with W. J. Jeffery. Ammong Becke's books are: The Naval Pioneers of Australia (1899), and By Rock and Pool on an Austral Shore and Other Stories (1901).",4.00,5:0|4:1|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:1,0,0,,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1437803199,9781437803198,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4075958-edward-barry

I suppose I shan't be able to decide about the state of my feelings until I've had more of them on the same subject, or until I've written down in this book of mine everything exactly as it's happened. I like doing that; it makes things seem so clear when you try to review them afterwards. The excitement began at breakfast by Mother having a letter that she liked. I knew she liked it by the way her eyes lighted up, as if they had been lamps and the letter a match.

But working-class Pontypridd agrees on one thing--the ""crache,"" or gentry, who live in the big houses on the Common, may be just the other side of town, but they inhabit a different world.

23471,19179378,"A History of the Four Georges and of William IV, Volume III",Justin Huntly McCarthy,"Excerpt:<br />""SUPREME IRONIC PROCESSION."" For six and forty years England had been ruled by German princes. One Elector of Hanover named George had been succeeded by another Elector of Hanover named George, and George the First and George the Second, George the father and George the son, resembled each other in being by nature German rather than English, and by inclination Electors of Hanover rather than Kings of England. Against each of them a Stuart prince had raised a standard and an army. George the First had his James Francis Edward, who called himself James the Third, and whom his opponents called the Pretender, by a translation which gave an injurious signification to the French word ""pretendant."" George the Second had his Charles Edward, the Young Pretender who a generation later led an invading army well into England before he had to turn and fly for his life. A very different condition of things awaited the successor of George the Second. George the Second's grandson was an English prince and an Englishman. He was born in England; his father was born in England; his native tongue was the English tongue; and if he was Elector of Hanover, that seemed an accident. The title was as unimportant and trivial to the King of {2} England as his title of King of France was unreal and theatrical. The remnant of the Jacobites could not with truth call the heir to the throne a foreigner, and they could not in reason hope to make such a demonstration in arms against him as they had made against his grandfather and his great-grandfather. The young King came to a much safer throne under much more favorable auspices than either of the two monarchs, his kinsmen and his namesakes, who had gone before him. [Sidenote: 1760-Accession of George the Third] The young King heard the first formal news of his accession to the throne from the lips of no less stately a personage than the Great Commoner himself-the foremost Englishman then alive. George the Third, as he then actually was, had received at Kew Palace some messages which told him that his grandfather was sinking fast, that he was dying, that he was dead. George resolved to start for London. On his way, and not far from Kew, he was met by a coach and six, which, from the blue and silver liveries, he knew to be that of Mr. Pitt. George received the congratulations of his great minister-the great Minister whom, as it was soon to appear, he understood so little and esteemed so poorly. Then Pitt, turning his horses' heads, followed his sovereign into London. Never perhaps in English history was a young king welcomed on his accession by so great a minister. Among the many auspicious conditions which surrounded the early days of George the Third's reign not the least auspicious was the presence of such a bulwark to the throne and to the realm. For the name of Pitt was now feared and honored in every civilized country in the world. It had become synonymous with the triumphs and the greatness of England. Pitt was the greatest War Minister England had yet known....",3.67,5:1|4:1|3:0|2:1|1:0|total:3,3,0,,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19179378-a-history-of-the-four-georges-and-of-william-iv-volume-iii

He has the hoarse voice of a mariner accustomed to out-roar storms, but his conversation is oddly free of the colorful oaths of the nautical man.<br /><br />His name is Ben Baltic -- and his entrance marks the reader's first acquaintance with the most interesting and colorful of detectives created by Fergus Hume (1859-1932), author of ""The Mystery of a Hansom Cab"" and ""The Secret Passage.""",3.58,5:9|4:27|3:24|2:5|1:1|total:66,49,9,,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,813204150X,9788132041504,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7567835-the-bishop-s-secret

The two elsewhere had met with marked success in ""locating"" rancherias of the hostile bands, and in following and finding marauding parties. The two were looked upon in southern Arizona as ""the best in the business,"" and now, because other leaders had tried much and accomplished little, it had pleased the general commanding the Division of the Pacific to say to his subordinate, the general commanding the Department of Arizona, that as the ""Tonto"" Apaches and their fellows of the Sierra Blanca seemed too wily for his scouting parties sent out from Whipple Barracks, and the valley garrisons of McDowell and Verde, it might be well to detach Lieutenant Harris from his troop at old Camp Bowie and send him, with 'Tonio, to report to the commanding officer at Camp Almy. <br />Now the commanding general of Arizona had thought of that project himself, and rejected it for two reasons: first, that the officers and men on duty at Almy would possibly take it as a reflection; second, that 'Tonio would probably take it as an affront to himself. 'Tonio, be it understood, was of the Apache Mohave tribe, whose hunting grounds had long been the upper Verde and adjacent mountains.

23497,35768237,Through Forest and Stream the Quest of the Quetzal,George Manville Fenn,"Why we were there. The captain of the steamer stopped by where I was watching the flying fish fizz out of the blue-ink-like water, skim along for some distance, and drop in again, often, I believe, to be snapped up by some bigger fish; and he gave me a poke in the shoulder with one finger, so hard, that it hurt. ""Yes?"" I said, for he stood looking hard in my face, while I looked back harder in his, for it seemed such a peculiar way of addressing one, and his manner was more curious still. He was naturally a smooth-faced man with a very browny-yellow skin, and he kept on passing the finger with which he had poked me over first one cheek and then over the other, just as if he were shaving himself without soap. Then his speech seemed more peculiar than his manner, for he repeated my one word, only instead of pronouncing it yes, he turned it into yuss. He looked so comic and puzzled that I smiled, and the smile became a laugh. I was sorry directly after, because it seemed rude to one who had been very civil to me ever since we left Kingston Harbour. ""'Tain't nothing to laugh at, young feller,"" he said, frowning. ""I've been talking to him yonder, and I can't make nothing of him. He's a re-lay-tive of yours, isn't he?"" ""Yes; my uncle,"" I replied. ""Well, I'm afraid he don't know what he's cut out for himself, and I think I ought to tell you, so as you may talk to him and bring him to his senses."" ""There's no need,"" I said, quickly. ""Oh, yes, there is, my lad. He don't know what he's got before him, and it's right that you should. He's going shooting, isn't he?"" ""Yes."" ""Nattralist?"" ""Yes."" ""Well, he don't know what the parts are like where he's going. Do you know what fevers is?"" ""Oh, yes,"" I replied; ""I've heard of them often."" ""Well, the coast yonder's where they're made, my lad. Natur's got a big workshop all along there, and she makes yaller ones, and black ones; scarlet, too, I dessay, though I never see none there that colour."" ""Uncle's a doctor,"" I said, ""and he'll know all about that."" ""But he's going, he tells me, to shoot birds in the forests and up the rivers, and means to skin 'em, and he won't do it."" ""Why not?"" I said. ""Why not? Because if the fevers don't stop you both, the Injuns will; and if they don't, you'll get your boat capsized in the rivers or along the coast, or you'll get lost in the woods and never be heerd of again."" ""Uncle's an old, experienced traveller,"" I said, ""and has been a great deal in South America."" ""You warn't with him there, was you?"" ""No,"" I said; ""but I was with him in the East Indian Islands."" ""Then you tell him to stop about the West Indy Islands. He may get some birds there, but he won't if he goes to the coast yonder. You tell him I say so."" ""What's the use?"" I said. ""Uncle has made his plans."" ""Oh, yes, and he thinks he's going to do wonders with that cranky cockboat."" He turned and nodded his head contemptuously at our good-sized boat lashed on the deck amidships....",0.00,5:0|4:0|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:0,0,0,,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1548044172,9781548044176,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35768237-through-forest-and-stream-the-quest-of-the-quetzal

23499,573310,The Hunters' Feast: Conversations Around the Camp-Fire,Thomas Mayne Reid,"The only account of Reid's hunting trip with John J. Audubon from St. Louis to the Osage country, 300 miles southwest of Independence, Missouri. Stories about hunting cougars, squirrels, raccoons, moose, bears, buffalo and more. These tales of hunting and knowledge of a naturalist, combine to tell of life in the far West. Mayne Reid, a pre-eminent and popular writer, was primarily a novelist (1818-1883) who wrote adventure stories from just before the Civil War until his death in 1883. Reid's career included two periods in the U. S: 1840-49 and 1867-70. He had emigrated to the United States in his early twenties, reaching New Orleans in January, 1840, where he pursued a varied career as a shopkeeper, overseer of slaves, schoolmaster, and actor, with occasional forays into hunting and Indian warfare. Reid returned to England in 1849, and embarked upon a successful career as a writer of adventure novels and books for boys. He was a close friend of Poe (though their writings were miles apart), played a gallant role in the Mexican War, worked as a journalist and wrote most of his first novel while in the United States. He was an influence on the young mind of Teddy Roosevelt, as Roosevelt reveals in his Autobiography; while Arthur Conan Doyle wrote in his 1890s essay Juvenilia that when young he always kept ""Mr. Ballantyne or Captain Mayne Reid at my elbow; "" Robert Louis Stevenson praised Reid in the Vailima Letters, and J. Frank Dobie has said he, ""dared convey real information in his romances.""",5.00,5:3|4:0|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:3,1,0,384,University Press of the Pacific,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1410221407,9781410221407,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/573310.The_Hunters_Feast

23503,18050185,Cathedral of the Wild: An African Journey Home,Boyd Varty,"<b>A colorful, moving, and dramatic memoir of personal transformation, set against one of the most famous game reserves in the world.</b><br /><br />When Nelson Mandela was released after twenty-seven years of imprisonment, he needed a place to recover and adjust to his new life. He went to Londolozi Game Reserve. Founded over eighty years ago by Boyd Varty's great-grandfather, Londolozi started as a hunting safari. But in 1973, Boyd's visionary father, Dave, transformed it into a nature reserve, creating a blueprint for modern-day conservation. This transformation is the backdrop of Boyd's family history and his own personal odyssey.<br /><br />Alongside his feisty, daring sister, Bronwyn, Boyd grows up learning to track lions, raise leopard cubs, and pilot Land Rovers. The two of them tag along with their larger-than-life uncle, John, who repeatedly flung them in danger's way to capture the best footage for his legendary wildlife videos. Boyd survives harrowing rhino charges and a vicious crocodile attack, but his most difficult challenge was a private crisis of purpose. After a period of intense spiritual questing, Boyd reconnects with nature and is able to ""rediscover the track.""<br /><br />With conviction, hope and humor, Boyd sweeps readers along his journey of discovery and rediscovery, making a passionate claim for the power of the wild to heal and restore the human spirit.",4.15,5:392|4:361|3:163|2:28|1:9|total:953,729,131,281,Random House,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1377884038l/18050185._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1377884038l/18050185._SY75_.jpg,1400069858,9781400069859,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18050185-cathedral-of-the-wild

23526,10463695,A Velhice do Padre Eterno,Guerra Junqueiro,"<i>A Velhice do Padre Eterno</i> é uma coleção de sátiras contra os dogmas e os ritos do catolicismo, [...] dedicada à memória de Guilherme de Azevedo e a Eça de Queirós, publicada em 1885. Na composição inicial, «Aos Simples», [Guerra Junqueiro] esclarece que apenas pretende atacar os dogmas e o clero, e não os que têm fé, e proclama a sua própria «crença robusta»: «Mas também acredito, embora isso vos pese, / E me julgueis talvez o maior dos ateus, / Que no universo inteiro há uma só diocese / E uma só catedral com um só bispo - Deus.» Ao longo do livro, o autor censura violentamente a deturpação do ideal cristão primitivo (veja-se «A vinha do Senhor»), o fanatismo religioso, o ritualismo oco, o jesuitismo, as superstições obscurantistas e o Vaticano (a que chama «bordel da Igreja»). Pela sua violência, inusitada nos [...] meios literários [de Portugal], a obra foi e vem sendo ainda censurada pelos sectores cristãos. No entanto, juntamente com <i>A Morte de D. João</i>, ela destinava-se a ser inscrita num tríptico, projetado pelo autor, e que este não viria a concluir, em que, depois de demolidos D. João e o Padre Eterno, se deveria glorificar Prometeu e Jesus Cristo.<br /><br /><i>A Velhice do Padre Eterno</i>. In Infopédia [Em linha]. Porto: Porto Editora, 2003-2012. [Consult. 2012-04-11]. Disponível na www: <br /><br />Em seguida à <i>Morte de D. João</i>, comecei a escrever um novo poema - <i>A Morte do Padre Eterno</i> (<i>A Morte de Jeová era o título primitivo.), cujo plano completo, até aos mínimos detalhes, estava de há muito elaborado no meu espírito.<br /><br />Mas, em tôrno dessa ideia principal, germinou um grande número de ideias acessórias, donde nasceu um livro novo. <i>A Velhice do Padre Eterno</i>, colecção de 50 poesias, que são 50 balas, que partindo de diversos pontos, vão todas bater no mesmo alvo.<br /><br />Guerra Junqueiro - <i>A Velhice do Padre Eterno</i>. Julho de 1885<br /><br />Neste livro [Guerra Junqueiro] dispara balas contra a Igreja, mas não contra Deus. O anticlericalismo de [Junqueiro] manifesta-se forte aqui, com críticas ferozes aos curas e aos papas, sua gula, avareza, ganância e todos os defeitos possíveis. Mas aparece também o sentimento de religiosidade, já que o autor não nega a existência de Deus, apenas a validade e moralidade da Igreja Católica. Este livro foi ilustrado por Leal da Câmara, que reflete em suas aguarelas os sentimentos e impressões de [Guerra Junqueiro], com padres bonachões e imagens como Jesus conversando com Voltaire e Deus escarrando. [Sob o] aspecto técnico, [Junqueiro] usa rimas em todos os versos, apesar de não se perder exageradamente a metrificação. <br /><br /><a target=""_blank"" href=""http://www.pobrevirtual.com.br/default/resumodelivrosdesc.php?rec_codigo=67"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pobrevirtual.com.br/defaul...</a></i>",3.82,5:13|4:17|3:9|2:3|1:2|total:44,37,4,,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1172056927,9781172056927,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10463695-a-velhice-do-padre-eterno

23532,6544806,"Betrachtung, Und Der Heizer",Franz Kafka,"Franz Kafka (1883-1924) war ein deutschsprachiger Schriftsteller. Er absolvierte ein Studium der Rechte von 1901 bis 1906 an der Karl-Ferdinands-Universitat zu Prag. Von 1908 bis 1922 arbeitete Kafka in der aArbeiter-Unfall- Versicherungs-Anstalt fur das KAnigreich BA<br /><br />hmena (AUVA) in Prag. Seine Arbeit bezeichnete er selbst oft als bloAen aBrotberufa. Der junge Kafka furchtete sich nicht unbedingt vor seinem Vater, aber er stand stets auf Distanz zu ihm. In vielen Werken Kafkas wird der Vater, das Familienoberhaupt, als sehr machtig, stark und partiell auch als unterdruckend dargestellt; so in Die Verwandlung (1915). 1912 gelang es Kafka, die Erzahlung Das Urteil (1913) in nur acht Stunden in einem Zuge zu Papier zu bringen. Das Urteil leitete Kafkas erste langere Kreativphase ein; die zweite folgte rund zwei Jahre spater. Zum grA<br /><br />Aeren Teil wurden Kafkas Werke erst nach seinem Tod und gegen seinen erklarten Willen von Max Brod, einem Schriftstellerkollegen und engen Freund, verA<br /><br />ffentlicht. Weitere Werke des Autors sind u. a.: In der Strafkolonie (1919), Der Kubelreiter (1921), Heimkehr (1920), Der Prozess (1925) und Das Schloss (1926).",3.45,5:6|4:3|3:6|2:4|1:1|total:20,15,1,72,Dodo Press,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1409928373,9781409928379,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6544806-betrachtung-und-der-heizer

And the case of Jason Howley was certainly an instance of one of those times.<br />When he came to my office with his gadget, I heard him out, trying to appear both interested and co-operative--which is good business. But I am forced to admit that neither Howley nor his gadget were very impressive. He was a lean, slope-shouldered individual, five-feet-eight or nine--which was shorter than he looked--with straight brown hair combed straight back and blue eyes which were shielded with steel-rimmed glasses. The thick, double-concave lenses indicated a degree of myopia that must have bordered on total blindness without glasses, and acute tunnel vision, even with them.",3.55,5:2|4:9|3:10|2:1|1:0|total:22,19,1,,eBook-Ventures,eng,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10780118-or-your-money-back

With Aelyx, her L’eihr boyfriend, back on Earth, working to mend the broken alliance between their two planets, Cara is left to fend for herself at a new school, surrounded by hostile alien clones. Even the weird dorm pet hates her.<br /><br />Things look up when Cara is appointed as human representative to a panel preparing for a human colony on L’eihr. A society melding their two cultures is a place where Cara and Aelyx could one day make a life together. But with L’eihr leaders balking at granting even the most basic freedoms, Cara begins to wonder if she could ever be happy on this planet, even with Aelyx by her side.<br /><br />Meanwhile, on Earth, Aelyx, finds himself thrown into a full-scale PR campaign to improve human-L’eihr relations. Humans don’t know that their very survival depends on this alliance: only Aelyx’s people have the technology to fix the deadly contamination in the global water supply that human governments are hiding. Yet despite their upper hand, the leaders of his world suddenly seem desperate to get humans on their side, and hardly bat an eye at extremists’ multiple attempts on Aelyx’s life.<br /> <br />The Way clearly needs humans’ help . . . but with what?

23555,29087912,The Lost Guidon: 1911,Mary Noailles Murfree,"Night came early. It might well seem that day had fled affrighted. The heavy masses of clouds, glooming low, which had gathered thicker and thicker, as if crowding to witness the catastrophe, had finally shaken asunder in the concussions of the air at the discharges of artillery, and now the direful rain, always sequence of the shock of battle, was steadily falling, falling, on the stricken field. Many a soldier who might have survived his wounds would succumb to exposure to the elements during the night, debarred the tardy succor that must needs await his turn. One of the surgeons at their hasty work at the field hospital, under the shelter of the cliffs on the slope, paused to note the presage of doom and death, and to draw a long breath before he adjusted himself anew to the grim duties of the scalpel in his hand. His face was set and haggard, less with a realization of the significance of the scene-for he was used to its recurrence-than simply with a physical reflection of horror, as if it were glassed in a mirror.

He was nutty enough to think he could make an atom bomb out of modeling clay!</i> <em>opening to story:</em> Miss Abercrombie, the manual therapist patted the old man on the shoulder. ""You're doing just fine, Mr. Lieberman. Show it to me when you have finished."" The oldster in the stained convalescent suit gave her a quick, shy smile and went back to his aimless smearing in the finger paints. Miss Abercrombie smoothed her smock down over trim hips and surveyed the other patients working at the long tables in the hospital's arts and crafts shop. Two muscular and bored attendants in spotless whites, lounged beside the locked door and chatted idly about the Dodgers' prospects for the pennant. Through the barred windows of the workshop, rolling green hills were seen, their tree-studded flanks making a pleasant setting for the mental institution. The crafts building was a good mile away from the main buildings of the hospital and the hills blocked the view of the austere complex of buildings that housed the main wards. The therapist strolled down the line of tables, pausing to give a word of advice here, and a suggestion there. She stopped behind a frowning, intense patient, rapidly shaping blobs of clay into odd-sized strips and forms. As he finished each piece, he carefully placed it into a hollow shell hemisphere of clay. ""And what are we making today, Mr. Funston?"" Miss Abercrombie asked. The flying fingers continued to whip out the bits of shaped clay as the patient ignored the question. He hunched closer to his table as if to draw away from the woman. ""We mustn't be antisocial, Mr. Funston,"" Miss Abercrombie said lightly, but firmly. ""You've been coming along famously and you must remember to answer when someone talks to you. Now what are you making? It looks very complicated."" She stared professionally at the maze of clay parts. Thaddeus Funston continued to mold the clay bits and put them in place. Without looking up from his bench he muttered a reply.

Much of his verse was based on classical mythological themes. One of Tennyson's most famous works is Idylls of the King (1859), a series of narrative poems based entirely on King Arthur and the Arthurian tales. During his career, Lord Tennyson attempted drama, but his plays enjoyed little success even in his lifetime. His first publication entitled Poems by Two Brothers was published in 1827. He published his first solo collection of poems, Poems Chiefly Lyrical in 1830. In 1833, Tennyson published his second book of poetry, which included his well-known poem, The Lady of Shalott. In 1842 Tennyson published two volumes of Poems. The Princess, a satire of women's education, which came out in 1847, was also popular. It was in 1850 that Tennyson reached the pinnacle of his career, being appointed Poet Laureate until his death. Amongst his other works are Becket and Other Plays (1884) and Lady Clare (1884).",3.66,5:13|4:19|3:17|2:6|1:1|total:56,31,2,52,Dodo Press,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1406570745,9781406570748,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7136620-beauties-of-tennyson

23611,29479,Remind Me Again Why I Married You,Rita Ciresi,"No one blends humor and heartbreak like Rita Ciresi, whose award-winning novels are lauded as much for their generous wit as for their unflinching honesty. Ciresi's crowd-pleasing novel, <i>Pink Slip</i>, captivated readers and critics alike, introducing two utterly unforgettable characters and a love story both bittersweet and comic. Now Ciresi returns to the people and place of that irresistible bestseller in a riotous and rueful, sexy and poignant tale of married love...a novel that asks how two people who fell desperately, passionately, heartbreakingly in love can sustain a second act.<br /><br />It's Valentine's Day, and Lisa Strauss, nee Diodetto, is spending it playing dutiful wife at a $100-a-head benefit instead of in bed with Eben, her hardworking husband of (is it only?) five years. Once upon a time, Lisa, too, was a member of the corporate workaday world--until she fell in love with her boss (Eben), gave birth to a cute but rambunctious son, and gradually morphed into a stay-at-home mom. Somewhere in the mix Lisa also is a writer with ambitions of fame and glory, but those dreams seem to be shrinking, along with her sex life. That is, until a hotshot literary agent shows interest in Lisa's magnum opus.<br /><br />Suddenly, she has a pen name, and an excerpt of her book appears in <i>Playboy</i>. In between revising chapters, Lisa is trying--and failing miserably--to get pregnant again. She's going house-hunting with Cynthia Farquhar, the gorgeous blond Realtor/divorcee who has become her closest confidante (and the object of Eben's secret fantasies). And she's wondering if this is all marriage is and can ever be: bonded for life to a man who may never again be the red-hot lover of their pre-marriage union. In fact, he just may turn out to be the conflicted protagonist of her novel--a devoted family man whose moral fiber may not be strong enough to withstand the slings and arrows of lust and temptation. As their lives begin to bizarrely mirror aspects of Lisa's book...as marital life as they know it teeters on the edge of utter chaos, Lisa and Eben search--apart and together--for the answer to the question that has plagued husbands and wives since time immemorial:<br /><br />Can love survive marriage?<br /><br />In a wickedly funny, right-on-target look at love and relationships, Rita Ciresi peels back the layers of a marriage with equal doses of hilarity and humanity. Filled with all the zest, zingers, and unexpected surprises of life, <b>Remind Me Again Why I Married You </b>is this uncommonly gifted author at her lusty and liberating best.",3.06,5:13|4:42|3:77|2:43|1:7|total:182,166,17,320,Delta,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320414092l/29479._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320414092l/29479._SY75_.jpg,0385335857,9780385335850,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29479.Remind_Me_Again_Why_I_Married_You

His second book is the natural extension of <i>Start with Why</i>, expanding his ideas at the organizational level. Determining a company’s WHY is crucial, but only the beginning. The next step is how do you get people on board with your WHY? How do you inspire deep trust and commitment to the company and one another? He cites the Marine Corps for having found a way to build a culture in which men and women are willing to risk their lives, because they know others would do the same for them. It’s not brainwashing; it’s actually based on the biology of how and when people are naturally at their best. If businesses could adopt this supportive mentality, employees would be more motivated to take bigger risks, because they’d know their colleagues and company would back them up, no matter what. Drawing on powerful and inspiring stories, Sinek shows how to sustain an organization’s WHY while continually adding people to the mix.<br />",4.14,5:9194|4:7975|3:3544|2:885|1:300|total:21898,18672,1431,350,Portfolio,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1400881733l/16144853._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1400881733l/16144853._SY75_.jpg,1591845327,9781591845324,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16144853-leaders-eat-last

He became a priest eight years later, and served as a missionary to the Arawak (Taino) of Cuba in 1512.

A partir de ce roman (et de sa celebre preface), Paul Bourget se fait donc, peu a peu, plus moralisateur que moraliste et propose des types de personnages, aux traits parfois pousses a l'exces, dont les actes sont analyses au regard de la morale, le plus souvent chretienne.

23634,589514,Italian Popular Tales,Thomas Frederick Crane,"Originally published in 1885, <em>Italian Popular Tales</em> is a fascinating trove of fairy tales, legends, ghost stories, nursery tales, and jests, and other oral accounts that were collected, recorded, translated, and annotated by Thomas Crane, the first folklorist to bring the riches of Italian oral tradition to the English-speaking world.<br /><br />Collectors in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries unearthed a wealth of stories from around the world and published them in English translations for the delight of general readers, young and old. Sadly, most of these anthologies have long been out of print. <em>Italian Popular Tales</em> brings back to life this key anthology of traditional tales from the golden age of folklore discovery. Crane's monumental achievement illustrates the enormous scope of his research, incomparable to other collections in the English language. In this modern edition, Crane's love for his work shines through the scholarship just as it did more than a century ago.<br /><br />The volume presents a virtually unaltered edition of this classic work that is enhanced by an authoritative Introduction by Jack Zipes. This insightful essay discusses the significance of the collection and its original collector; the original collector's methodology and translation practices; and the original period context.<br /><br />Certain to be of interest to folklorists, this classic collection is also meant to delight and amuse readers, whether a parent, storyteller, teacher, student, scholar, or just someone who enjoys original stories and authentic folk wisdom.<br />",3.64,5:7|4:7|3:11|2:3|1:0|total:28,14,4,392,"Oxford University Press, USA",,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,0195219295,9780195219296,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/589514.Italian_Popular_Tales

Four years after the bursting of the great consumer debt bubble, the country is dangerously overleveraged and underemployed. The United States is quickly losing its competitive edge against the goods-producing industries of China and India. In an environment of stagnated government leadership, five highly accomplished entrepreneurial leaders step forward. They hope to solve the economic problems by implementing “Employ American,” a step-by-step strategy designed to restore the competitiveness of American manufacturers. Sovereign governments, offshore manufacturers, foreign oil producers, and domestic power-generating utility companies are threatened by the possible realization of the “Employ American” plan. Their efforts to prevent the Sentinels from achieving their goal are constantly, menacingly present. A Matter of Importance unfolds through the drama of the evolving lives of each of the principal characters.

23659,38820046,21 Lessons for the 21st Century,Yuval Noah Harari,"<b>In<i> Sapiens, </i>he explored our past. In <i>Homo Deus, </i>he looked to our future<i>. </i>Now, one of the most innovative thinkers on the planet turns to the present to make sense of today's most pressing issues.</b><br /><br />How do computers and robots change the meaning of being human? How do we deal with the epidemic of fake news? Are nations and religions still relevant? What should we teach our children?<br /><br />Yuval Noah Harari's <i>21 Lessons for the 21st Century</i> is a probing and visionary investigation into today's most urgent issues as we move into the uncharted territory of the future. As technology advances faster than our understanding of it, hacking becomes a tactic of war, and the world feels more polarized than ever, Harari addresses the challenge of navigating life in the face of constant and disorienting change and raises the important questions we need to ask ourselves in order to survive.<br /><br />In twenty-one accessible chapters that are both provocative and profound, Harari builds on the ideas explored in his previous books, untangling political, technological, social, and existential issues and offering advice on how to prepare for a very different future from the world we now live in: How can we retain freedom of choice when Big Data is watching us? What will the future workforce look like, and how should we ready ourselves for it? How should we deal with the threat of terrorism? Why is liberal democracy in crisis?<br /><br />Harari's unique ability to make sense of where we have come from and where we are going has captured the imaginations of millions of readers. Here he invites us to consider values, meaning, and personal engagement in a world full of noise and uncertainty. When we are deluged with irrelevant information, clarity is power. Presenting complex contemporary challenges clearly and accessibly, <i>21 Lessons for the 21st Century</i> is essential reading.",4.19,5:20161|4:16763|3:6696|2:1478|1:556|total:45654,35958,3212,372,Spiegel & Grau,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1564577305l/38820046._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1564577305l/38820046._SY75_.jpg,0525512179,9780525512172,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38820046-21-lessons-for-the-21st-century

As Kelsey digs deeper, despite danger and warnings, she feels a growing connection to the dead girl.

23720,9376272,Lesbia Brandon,Algernon Charles Swinburne,"Algernon Charles Swinburne (1837-1909) constituye el más evidente eslabón literario entre el mundo de Byon, Shelley, Southey, y en general el romanticismo inglés y los últimos coletazos del ya decadente victorianismo, representados en la figura de Wilde. Amigo personal del último representante del círculo byroniano, W. Savage Landor, a quien conocería, ya viejo, en su retiro de Fiésole; compañero de universidad, en Oxford, de los máximos representantes del prerrafaelismo —Rossetti, Morris, Burne-Jones—, a quienes acompañaría en sus primeros pasos; amigo y admirador de Hugo y Manzzini, cuyos intereses políticos compartiría, anticipándose con ello al tardío interés político de los literatos ingleses; y precursor, en definitiva, gracias a su muy peculiar interés por Sade, de muchos de los temas de Wilde y Carpenter, Swinburne constituye una especie de resumen simbólico de las diversas corrientes literarias, culturales y políticas que durante la segunda mitad del pasado siglo surgen en Inglaterra, o vienen a prender en ella procedentes del Continente.<br /><br />Conocido y admirado fundamentalmente por sus baladas de aire tradicional (<i>Poems &amp; Ballads</i>, 1866 y 1878) y por sus grandes poemas dramáticos (<i>Atlanta in Calydon</i>, 1865, y <i>Erechteus</i>, 1876, sobre todo), así como por su gran trilogía dramático-histórica (<i>Chastelard</i>, 1865. <i>Bothwell</i>, 1874 y <i>Mary Stuart</i>, 1881), su obra en prosa, perteneciente a su época más productiva —entre 1860 y 1865— resulta casi por completo desconocida. De hecho, de dicha obra en prosa, sólo una novela epistolar —hecha sobre el modelo de <i>Las relaciones peligrosas</i>, de Laclos— <i>Love's Cross Currents</i>, llegó a quedar terminada. Las otras dos, <i>Tebaldeo Tebaldei</i> —falsa crónica de tiempos de Lucrecia Borgia, muy influida por el prerrafelismo— y la que aquí se presenta en traducción, <i>Lesbia Brandon</i>, quedaron inconclusas y arrinconadas.<br /><br /><i>Lesbia Brandon</i> tiene, sin embargo, el interés —a pesar de su inconclusión, y del montaje póstumo e hipotético realizado por manos de la crítica—, de constituir el primer y casi único caso de “educación sentimental” a la inglesa, escrita por manos no femeninas. Trozos de vida, aficiones, las pasiones y los intereses de Swinburne aparecen traspuestos en ella, perfectamente engarzados con el ambiente de su época. Y un aura masoquista —continuamente enlazada con la tradición flagelística inglesa y las particulares aficiones de Swinburne en este sentido— aparece recorriéndola toda. Una especie, en definitiva, de cuadro de época, que expresa más de lo que en la época era permisible, y menos de lo que hoy, tal vez, desearíamos.",3.86,5:2|4:3|3:1|2:1|1:0|total:7,6,1,,,spa,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1564903448l/9376272._SY160_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1564903448l/9376272._SY75_.jpg,8485346475,9788485346479,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9376272-lesbia-brandon

23722,2696,The Canterbury Tales,Geoffrey Chaucer,"<p>The procession that crosses Chaucer's pages is as full of life and as richly textured as a medieval tapestry. The Knight, the Miller, the Friar, the Squire, the Prioress, the Wife of Bath, and others who make up the cast of characters -- including Chaucer himself -- are real people, with human emotions and weaknesses. When it is remembered that Chaucer wrote in English at a time when Latin was the standard literary language across western Europe, the magnitude of his achievement is even more remarkable. But Chaucer's genius needs no historical introduction; it bursts forth from every page of <i>The Canterbury Tales.</i><br /><br />If we trust the General Prologue, Chaucer intended that each pilgrim should tell two tales on the way to Canterbury and two tales on the way back. He never finished his enormous project and even the completed tales were not finally revised. Scholars are uncertain about the order of the tales. As the printing press had yet to be invented when Chaucer wrote his works, The Canterbury Tales has been passed down in several handwritten manuscripts.</p>",3.49,5:34209|4:54404|3:58364|2:21431|1:7576|total:175984,164052,2310,504,Penguin Classics,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1261208589l/2696._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1261208589l/2696._SY75_.jpg,0140424385,9780140424386,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2696.The_Canterbury_Tales

This wouldn't be interesting at all, though, if he didn't also show such passion for giving the devil his due.

23724,58345,The Awakening,Kate Chopin,"When first published in 1899, <i>The Awakening</i> shocked readers with its honest treatment of female marital infidelity. Audiences accustomed to the pieties of late Victorian romantic fiction were taken aback by Chopin's daring portrayal of a woman trapped in a stifling marriage, who seeks and finds passionate physical love outside the confines of her domestic situation.<br /><br />Aside from its unusually frank treatment of a then-controversial subject, the novel is widely admired today for its literary qualities. Edmund Wilson characterized it as a work ""quite uninhibited and beautifully written, which anticipates D. H. Lawrence in its treatment of infidelity.""

23728,12039218,Walter and the Wireless,Sara Ware Bassett,"Excerpt:<br />His Highness came by the nickname honestly enough and yet those who heard it for the first time had difficulty in repressing a smile at the incongruity of the title. In fact perhaps no term could have been found that would have been less appropriate. For Walter King possessed neither dignity of rank nor of stature. On the contrary he was a short, snub-nosed boy of fifteen, the epitome of good humor and democracy. His hair was red and towsled, his face spangled with great golden freckles which sea winds and sunshine had multiplied until there was scarce room for another on his beaming countenance. Hands and arms were freckled too, for when one lives in a bathing suit six months of the year and is either in the water or on it most of the time the skin fails to retain its pristine whiteness of hue. But His Highness did not care a fig for that. He was far too busy baiting eel and lobster traps, mending fish nets, untangling lines, and painting boats to give a thought to his personal beauty. Indeed his mother often bewailed the fact that he was not more interested in his appearance and there were times when it seemed as if she were right. Certainly when her son ambled home at dusk with every rebellious hair standing upended upon his head and a string of flounders dripping salt from the tips of their slimy tails she was justified to a degree in wishing he had more regard for the niceties of life. ""Look at the mess you're making!"" she would pipe indignantly. ""I've just mopped this floor, Walter."" ""You have? Now isn't that the dickens! Well, no matter, Ma; I'll swab the place down again when I've finished cleaning these fish. They're beauties, aren't they? A batch of them fried won't go bad for supper to-night. I'm hungry as a bear. Shouldn't think I'd eaten anything in ten years. Say, Ma, what do you s'pose? Dave Corbett was out in the Nancy three hours and never got a bite. What do you think of that? The wind died down, his engine got stalled, and he and Hosey Talbot had to row home from the Bell Reef Shoals. Haw, haw! Maybe I didn't roar when I saw them come pulling in against the tide, mad as two man-eating sharks. Fit to harpoon the first person they met, they were. I sung out and asked them were they practicing for the Harvard and Yale boat race and Dave was that peeved he shied an oarlock after me.

23742,35770576,Charley's Museum a Story for Young People,Unknown,"Excerpt CHARLEY'S MUSEUM. Charley Carter was a bright, active lad, of twelve years old, the son of a farmer, who lived a few miles distant from Philadelphia. He was a very great favorite of his uncle Brown, his mother's brother, who was a wealthy merchant in the city. He was also a favorite of another brother of his mother, who had been, for many years a sea captain, sailing to all parts of the world. So, you see, our Charley, with a kind father and mother, and two such uncles, was very well provided for. Charley was a lively, inquiring boy, who liked to find out all he could about the animals he saw, whether they flew through the air, or swam through the water, or walked on the ground, or crawled in the dirt. MR. BROWN AND CHARLEY. Luckily for our Charley, his uncle Brown had had, from boyhood, the same taste for Natural History, which our little friend was beginning to have, and you can imagine how pleased his uncle was to see this taste in his little nephew. Our sea captain was pleased also, and so was his father, and all three of them together, determined that our little boy should have the opportunity and the means to cultivate his taste. So, as Mr. Carter had a big attic to his house, with two good sized windows fronting the south, he got a carpenter and had a nice room made for Charley, that should be his own Museum. Don't you think our Charley was pleased, that his father was so kind to him? When the room was all finished, uncle Brown, who had, for a long time, a bit of a Museum in his own house, in the city, brought out, one day, a lot of shells to begin our Charley's Museum, with. And now I must try to tell something about these shells, and the creatures who used to have their homes in them. (But first I must tell you one thing, if you hav'nt guessed it already, that as soon as Charley began to lisp his words, his kind mother took him in her lap and taught him to repeat the Lord's Prayer, and, I can tell you, Charley, as he grew older, never went to sleep at night, until he had addressed this prayer to the great, good Being, who made and takes care of all of us. Remember this, boys, for it is of more consequence than shells, or animals, or anything else.) MONEY-COWRY. The first shell that Uncle Brown gave to Charley, was what is called a ""money-cowry."" It is an elegant shaped and beautifully marked shell and takes its name from the fact, that one species of them is used as money, both in Bengal and Guinea, two places at a vast distance from each other. The value of these shells is small, in comparison with that of gold and silver, three thousand two hundred cowries amounting to a rupee, which equals fifty cents of our coin. ROYAL STAIRCASE WENTLETRAP. Next came a shell that Charley thought had a very funny name, ""the Royal Staircase Wentle-trap."" However, it was a very handsome shell, that uncle sea captain brought to uncle Brown from the far off Chinese and Indian seas, where the animals live. In old times this shell was prized so highly, that one, two inches long, sold for five hundred dollars. And, even now, a fine specimen brings from thirty to thirty-five dollars. This shell Mr. Brown said, belongs to the class Turbo or Turbinidae. The fisherman call all of this class, whelks. COMMON WHELK.

23753,6948112,The Diverting History of John Gilpin,William Cowper,"William Cowper (1731-1800) was born in Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, England. He was an English poet and hymnodist. One of the most popular poets of his time, Cowper changed the direction of 18th century nature poetry by writing of everyday life and scenes of the English countryside. His major works are: Olney Hymns (1779), in collaboration with John Newton, John Gilpin (1782), The Task (1785), and Homer's Iliad and Odyssey (1791) (translations from the Greek). He suffered from periods of severe depression, and although he found refuge in a fervent evangelical Christianity, the source of his much-loved hymns, he often experienced doubt and fears that he was doomed to eternal damnation. However, his religious motivations and association with John Newton (who wrote the hymn ""Amazing Grace"") led to much of the poetry for which he is best remembered in the popular mind.",3.59,5:7|4:9|3:16|2:1|1:1|total:34,18,5,50,E.

A genre-mixing science and swordplay adventure on the high seas, <i>Scrimshaw </i>tells the story of a possible future in which the world has been affected global warming, genetic and agricultural manipulation, and conflict between so-called superpowers. With members hailing from Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, and American Samoa, the crew of the Runaway Horse has a colorful past and an uncertain future. Tackling issues like global warming, overfishing, corporate exploitation, political over-reach, and race relations head-on, <i>Scrimshaw</i> also revolves around one of the oldest and most maligned traits that mankind possesses: our ability to make war.",3.67,5:4|4:3|3:3|2:1|1:1|total:12,12,2,120,Alterna,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1475876423l/32202316._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1475876423l/32202316._SY75_.jpg,1945762004,9781945762000,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32202316-scrimshaw-vol-1

The brilliance of the novel is Orwell's prescience of modern life--the ubiquity of television, the distortion of the language--and his ability to construct such a thorough version of hell.

  <i>A coming-of-age tale of fan fiction, family and first love.</i>
</b><br /><br />Cath is a Simon Snow fan.<br /><br />Okay, the whole world is a Simon Snow fan..<br /><br />But for Cath, being a fan is her life—and she’s really good at it. She and her twin sister, Wren, ensconced themselves in the Simon Snow series when they were just kids; it’s what got them through their mother leaving. Reading. Rereading. Hanging out in Simon Snow forums, writing Simon Snow fan fiction, dressing up like the characters for every movie premiere.<br /><br />Cath’s sister has mostly grown away from fandom, but Cath can’t let go. She doesn’t want to.<br /><br />Now that they’re going to college, Wren has told Cath she doesn’t want to be roommates. Cath is on her own, completely outside of her comfort zone. She’s got a surly roommate with a charming, always-around boyfriend, a fiction-writing professor who thinks fan fiction is the end of the civilized world, a handsome classmate who only wants to talk about words... And she can’t stop worrying about her dad, who’s loving and fragile and has never really been alone.<br /><br />For Cath, the question is: Can she do this? Can she make it without Wren holding her hand? Is she ready to start living her own life? Writing her own stories?<br /><br />And does she even want to move on if it means leaving Simon Snow behind?",4.08,5:216384|4:164548|3:85361|2:25320|1:13256|total:504869,463702,37360,483,St. Martin's Press,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1355886270l/16068905._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1355886270l/16068905._SX50_.jpg,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16068905-fangirl

23868,114550,Vanishing Point,David Markson,"In the literary world, there is little that can match the excitement of opening a new book by David Markson. From Wittgenstein’s Mistress to Reader’s Block to Springer’s Progress to This Is Not a Novel, he has delighted and amazed readers for decades. And now comes his latest masterwork, Vanishing Point, wherein an elderly writer (identified only as ""Author"") sets out to transform shoeboxes crammed with notecards into a novel — and in so doing will dazzle us with an astonishing parade of revelations about the trials and calamities and absurdities and often even tragedies of the creative life — all the while trying his best (he says) to keep himself out of the tale. Naturally he will fail to do the latter, frequently managing to stand aside and yet remaining undeniably central throughout — until he is swept inevitably into the narrative’s startling and shattering climax. A novel of death and laughter both — and of extraordinary intellectual richness.",3.90,5:405|4:445|3:245|2:76|1:45|total:1216,1203,138,191,Counterpoint,en-US,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327937400l/114550._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327937400l/114550._SX50_.jpg,1593760108,9781593760106,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/114550.Vanishing_Point

23881,7717372,The History of Punch,Marion Harry Spielmann,"Punch was a British weekly magazine of humour and satire published from 1841 to 1992 and from 1996 to 2002. Punch was founded by Henry Mayhew and engraver Ebenezer Landells. At its founding it was jointly edited by Mayhew and Mark Lemon. Initially it was subtitled The London Charivari, this being a reference to a satirical humour magazine published in France under the title Le Charivari. Reflecting their satiric and humourous intent, the two editors took for their name and masthead from the anarchic glove puppet, Mr. Punch; the name also referred to a joke made early on about one of the magazine's first editors, Lemon, that ""punch is nothing without lemon."" Punch was responsible for the modern use of the word 'cartoon' to refer to a comic drawing. Increasing in readership and popularity throughout the remainder of the 1840s and 1850s, Punch was the success story of a threepenny weekly paper that had become one of the most talked-about and enjoyed periodicals of its time. Several British humour classics were first serialised in Punch, such as the Diary of a Nobody and 1066 and All That.",4.00,5:0|4:1|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:1,1,0,620,Dodo Press,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1409946363,9781409946366,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7717372-the-history-of-punch

23895,8646751,The Buckle My Shoe Picture Book (Illustrated Edition),Walter Crane,"Walter Crane (1845-1915) was an English artist. Born in Liverpool, he was part of the Arts and Crafts movement. He produced paintings, illustrations, children's books, ceramic tiles and other decorative arts. In 1862 his picture The Lady of Shalott was exhibited at the Royal Academy, but the Academy steadily refused his maturer work; and after the opening of the Grosvenor Gallery in 1877 he ceased to send pictures to Burlington House. In 1864 he began to illustrate a series of sixpenny toy-books of nursery rhymes in three colours for Edmund Evans. He was allowed more freedom in a series beginning with The Frog Prince (1874) which showed markedly the influence of Japanese art, and of a long visit to Italy following his marriage in 1871. From the early 1880s, Crane was closely associated with the Socialist movement. He provided the weekly cartoons for the Socialist Organs Justice, The Commonweal and The Clarion. One of his last major works would be his Lunettes at the Royal West of England Academy which were painted in 1913.",3.44,5:3|4:2|3:2|2:0|1:2|total:9,2,0,,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8646751-the-buckle-my-shoe-picture-book

He has it all—family money, good looks, devoted friends—but he’s looking for much more than that. He is on a quest that has encompassed three other Raven Boys: Adam, the scholarship student who resents all the privilege around him; Ronan, the fierce soul who ranges from anger to despair; and Noah, the taciturn watcher of the four, who notices many things but says very little.<br /><br />For as long as she can remember, Blue has been warned that she will cause her true love to die.

23917,67762,Salomé,Oscar Wilde,"Outraged by the sexual perversity of this one-act tragedy, Great Britain's Lord Chamberlain banned <i>Salomé</i> from the national stage. Symbolist poets and writers — Stéphane Mallarmé and Maurice Maeterlinck among them — defended the play's literary brilliance. Beyond its notoriety, the drama's haunting poetic imagery, biblical cadences, and febrile atmosphere have earned it a reputation as a masterpiece of the Aesthetic movement of <i>fin de siècle</i> England.<br />Written originally in French in 1892, this sinister tale of a woman scorned and her vengeance was translated into English by Lord Alfred Douglas. The play inspired some of Aubrey Beardsley's finest illustrations, and an abridged version served as the text for Strauss' renowned opera of the same name. This volume reprints the complete text of the first English edition, published in 1894, and also includes ""A Note on Salomé"" by Robert Ross, Wilde's lifelong friend and literary executor. Students, lovers of literature and drama, and admirers of Oscar Wilde and his remarkable literary gifts will rejoice in this inexpensive edition.",3.69,5:2576|4:3666|3:3219|2:985|1:231|total:10677,9008,385,64,Dover Publications,eng,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,0486421279,9780486421278,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/67762.Salom_

23936,295,Treasure Island,Robert Louis Stevenson,"""For sheer storytelling delight and pure adventure, <i>Treasure Island</i> has never been surpassed. From the moment young Jim Hawkins first encounters the sinister Blind Pew at the Admiral Benbow Inn until the climactic battle for treasure on a tropic isle, the novel creates scenes and characters that have fired the imaginations of generations of readers. Written by a superb prose stylist, a master of both action and atmosphere, the story centers upon the conflict between good and evil - but in this case a particularly engaging form of evil. It is the villainy of that most ambiguous rogue Long John Silver that sets the tempo of this tale of treachery, greed, and daring. Designed to forever kindle a dream of high romance and distant horizons, <i>Treasure Island</i> is, in the words of G. K. Chesterton, 'the realization of an ideal, that which is promised in its provocative and beckoning map; a vision not only of white skeletons but also green palm trees and sapphire seas.' G. S. Fraser terms it 'an utterly original book' and goes on to write: 'There will always be a place for stories like <i>Treasure Island</i> that can keep boys and old men happy.'",3.83,5:101694|4:135206|3:99895|2:22272|1:6571|total:365638,310067,6498,311,Kingfisher,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1485248909l/295._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1485248909l/295._SX50_.jpg,0753453800,9780753453803,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/295.Treasure_Island

And she's losing hope of making a breakthrough before that happens.<br /><br />But the murders at the Cooper farmhouse didn't quite go according to plan.

23975,1641345,Spirits in Bondage: A Cycle of Lyrics,C.S. Lewis,"So piteously the lonely soul of man Shudders before this universal plan, So grievous is the burden and the pain, So heavy weighs the long, material chain From cause to cause, too merciless for hate, The nightmare march of unrelenting fate, -from ""Dungeon Grates"" C. S. Lewis is a profound and perhaps the most respected Christian apologist because his belief was so hard-won. This collection of verse, written immediately after he returned from the battlefields of World War I in 1919, offers penetrating insight into the psyche of a young man struggling with traumatic wartime experiences and the crisis of faith they engendered. By turns angry, bitter, and melancholy, these poems constitute a provocative document of Lewis's journey from atheism through agnosticism and on to conviction. Irish writer CLIVE STAPLES (""JACK"") LEWIS (1898-1963) was born in Belfast. A volunteer in the British Army during World War I, he served in the trenches of France, and returned to study and teach at Oxford University; he later accepted a post at Cambridge University, retiring only months before his death. His best-known works are The Chronicles of Narnia (1950-1956), Mere Christianity (1952), and his autobiography, Surprised by Joy (1955).",3.57,5:156|4:176|3:248|2:71|1:17|total:668,357,70,88,Cosimo Classics,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1596053720,9781596053724,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1641345.Spirits_in_Bondage

His nurse - not his ordinary one, but the state nurse-maid - an elegant and fashionable young lady of rank, whose duty it was to carry him to and from the chapel, had been so occupied in arranging her train with one hand, while she held the baby with the other, that she stumbled and let him fall, just at the foot of the marble staircase. To be sure, she contrived to pick him up again the next minute; and the accident was so slight it seemed hardly worth speaking of. Consequently nobody did speak of it. The baby had turned deadly pale, but did not cry, so no person a step or two behind could discover anything wrong; afterward, even if he had moaned, the silver trumpets were loud enough to drown his voice.

23990,10821923,Moor Fires,E.H. Young,"Emily Hilda Young (1880-1949) was an English novelist. She was a best-selling novelist of her time. In 1902, at the age of 22, she married Arthur Daniell, a solicitor from Bristol, and moved with him to the upscale neighbourhood of Clifton. Here, she developed an interest in classical and modern philosophy. She became a supporter of the suffragette movement, and started publishing novels. She also began a lifelong affair with Ralph Henderson, a schoolteacher and a friend of her husband. When the First World War broke out in 1914, she went to work, first as a stables groom and then in a munitions factory. Her husband was killed at the Battle of Ypres in 1917. The following year she moved to Sydenham Hill, London to join her lover and his wife in a ménage à trois. Young occupied a separate flat in their house and was addressed as 'Mrs. Daniell'; this concealed the unconventional arrangement. Seven major novels followed, all based on Clifton, thinly disguised as 'Upper Radstowe'. The first of these was The Misses Mallett, published originally under the title The Bridge Dividing in 1922. Her 1930 novel Miss Mole won the James Tait Black Award for fiction.",2.90,5:1|4:2|3:3|2:3|1:1|total:10,6,2,213,"Harcourt, Brace and Company",eng,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10821923-moor-fires

(George Henry) Napheys Were man's life measured by his deeds, as the poet suggests, how brief would be the long years of many an octogenarian, and how extended the short span which has been allotted to not a few of the world's famous heroes! This oft-repeated thought strikes us forcibly in considering the biography of the subject of this sketch. Closing his life at an age when most professional men are but beginning theirs, he had already studied broadly, had traveled widely over two continents, had gained credit and fame by the sword and the pen, and had amassed a fund of erudition and experience which the more lethargic lives of most men fail to approach after twice his length of days. It is eminently appropriate that a record of his busy career should be attached to the works on which his celebrity is chiefly bound, and in which he most conspicuously displays that command of language and happy facility of imparting instruction for which he was so remarkable. We are delighted to publish this classic book as part of our extensive Classic Library collection. Many of the books in our collection have been out of print for decades, and therefore have not been accessible to the general public. The aim of our publishing program is to facilitate rapid access to this vast reservoir of literature, and our view is that this is a significant literary work, which deserves to be brought back into print after many decades. The contents of the vast majority of titles in the Classic Library have been scanned from the original works.

A number of his popular works, Life Amongst the Modocs (1873), An Elk Hunt, and The Battle of Castle Crags, draw on these experiences. After losing his bid for a seat on the Oregon Supreme Court, and a failed marriage, he left the Pacific Northwest and spent some years travelling, living in and visiting England, New York, San Francisco, Washington, D.C., and Brazil. He eventually returned to settle in California, where he grew fruit and published his poems and other works.

24013,4915069,The Telegraph Boy,Horatio Alger Jr.,"1909. Alger is the original rags-to-riches guy, often credited with inventing the strive-and-succeed spirit that inspired boys to work hard and advance themselves in order to achieve the American Dream. This theme resonates throughout his numerous writings. When his father dies suddenly, Frank Kavanaugh is forced to live with his uncle and aunt. Unwilling to support Frank, his uncle urges him to move out. Frank decides to move to New York City where he works in a variety of positions, eventually becoming a Telegraph Boy. On one of his assignments he is asked to work as an errand boy for an importer. The importer knows that one of his employees is stealing large amounts of money from him. Frank's assignment is to learn the identity of the thief. Frank does his best to solve this mystery, and along the way receives a gift that will impact his life immensely.

24033,6731253,"Dave Porter in the Gold Fields or, The Search for the Landslide Mine",Edward Stratemeyer,"Edward Stratemeyer (1862-1930) was born in Elizabeth, New Jersey. He was an American publisher and writer of books for children. He wrote 150 books himself, and created the most famous of the series books for juveniles, including the Rover Boys (1899 and after), Bobbsey Twins (1904), Tom Swift (1910), Hardy Boys (1927), and Nancy Drew (1930) series, among others. Stratemeyer pioneered the technique of producing long-running, consistent series of books using a team of freelance authors to write standardised novels, which were published under a pen name owned by his company. Through his Stratemeyer Syndicate, founded in 1906, Stratemeyer produced short plot summaries for the novels in each series, which he sent to other writers who completed the story. Stratemeyer's series were also innovative in that they were intended purely as entertainment, with little of the moral lessons or educational intent found in most other popular fiction of the early twentieth century. Stratemeyer's series included, besides the famous ones, many that are now forgotten except by collectors: The Motor Boys (1906), Honey Bunch (1923), The Blythe Girls (1925) and Bomba the Jungle Boy (1926).",3.56,5:3|4:0|3:5|2:1|1:0|total:9,5,1,252,Dodo Press,eng,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1409967115,9781409967118,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6731253-dave-porter-in-the-gold-fields-or-the-search-for-the-landslide-mine

Though Charlotte Brontë's Jane Eyre was originally considered the best of the Brontë sisters' works, many subsequent critics of Wuthering Heights argued that its originality and achievement made it superior.

The mother sighed. ""Meanwhile there is almost two months to provide for, and I had to break in the last hundred dollars to pay the rent. Oh Lilian! I hardly know which way to turn. I am not strong any more, I have made every effort to-"" and her voice broke, ""but I am afraid you will have to give up school."" She buried her face in her hands and sobbed. ""Oh, mother, don't! don't!"" the girl implored. ""I suppose it was selfish of me to think of such a thing and you couldn't go through two years more. You are not as well as you were a year ago.

24089,6243900,The Five Jars,M.R. James,"M R James (1862 1936) was a writer and British medieval scholar. His well-known classic ghost stories have a Victorian Christmas theme. Although James is best known for his ghost stories, he produced many excellent scholarly works. He is also credited with cataloging libraries at Oxford and Cambridge. It is possible that the author is the central character in this ghost story written for children, but thrilling enough for adult readers. The 5 jars contain magic ointments that give the narrator special powers. Evil creatures try and stop him from using these powers. The creatures are able to assume normal and friendly appearances. As the narrator uses one jar per night he is able to interact more with animals. The cat s thoughts are quite fun to read. The introduction suggests that this book was not as popular as James s other ghost stories because it was too scary for children in that time. Today s kids will have no problem with this.""",3.52,5:52|4:55|3:94|2:25|1:7|total:233,130,24,72,Book Jungle,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1438504292,9781438504292,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6243900-the-five-jars

24106,35905770,一九八四,George Orwell,"Among the seminal texts of the 20th century, <i>Nineteen Eighty-Four</i> is a rare work that grows more haunting as its futuristic purgatory becomes more real. Published in 1949, the book offers political satirist George Orwell's nightmare vision of a totalitarian, bureaucratic world and one poor stiff's attempt to find individuality. The brilliance of the novel is Orwell's prescience of modern life--the ubiquity of television, the distortion of the language--and his ability to construct such a thorough version of hell. Required reading for students since it was published, it ranks among the most terrifying novels ever written.",4.17,5:1252115|4:894483|3:401905|2:107370|1:54666|total:2710539,5,0,316,志文出版社,zho,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1501768104l/35905770._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1501768104l/35905770._SX50_.jpg,,9789575455286,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35905770

24108,3192559,Fables in Rhyme for Little Folks,Jean de La Fontaine,"Jean de La Fontaine (1621-1695) was the most famous French fabulist and probably the most widely read French poet of the 17th century. According to Flaubert, he was the only French poet to understand and master the texture of the French language before Hugo. A set of postage stamps celebrating La Fontaine and the Fables was issued by France in 1995. It was not until he was past thirty that his literary career began. The reading of Malherbe, it is said, first awoke poetical fancies in him, but for some time he attempted nothing but trifles in the fashion of the time. His first serious work was a translation or adaptation of the Eunuchus of Terence (1654). At this time the Maecenas of French letters was the Superintendent Fouquet. He wrote a ballad, Les Rieurs du Beau-Richard, and this was followed by many small pieces of occasional poetry addressed to various personages from the king downwards. His works fall no less naturally than traditionally into three divisions, the Fables, the Contes and the miscellaneous works.",3.89,5:3|4:3|3:2|2:1|1:0|total:9,7,2,64,Dodo Press,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,140652249X,9781406522495,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3192559-fables-in-rhyme-for-little-folks

24120,8249259,The Hour And The Man; A Historical Romance,Harriet Martineau,"Excerpt from The Hour and the Man: An Historical Romance <br />The nights of August are in St. Domingo the hottest of the year. The winds then cease to befriend the panting inhabitants; and while the thermometer stands at 90, there is no steady breeze, as during the preceding months of summer. Light puffs of wind now and then fan the brow of the negro, and relieve for an instant the oppression of the European settler; but they are gone as soon as come, and seem only to have left the heat more intolerable than before. <br />Of these sultry evenings, one of the sultriest was the 22nd of August, 1791. This was one of five days appointed for rejoicings in the town of Cap Fran ais - festivities among the French and Creole inhabitants, who were as ready to rejoice on appointed occasions as the dulness of colonial life renders natural, but who would have been yet more lively than they were if the date of their festival had been in January or May. There was no choice as to the date, however. They were governed in regard to their celebrations by what happened at Paris; and never had the proceedings of the mother country been so important to the colony as now. <br />During the preceding year, the white proprietors of St. Domingo, who had hailed with loud voices the revolutionary doctrines before which royalty had begun to succumb in France, were astonished to find their cries of Liberty and Equality adopted by some who had no business with such ideas and words. The mulatto proprietors and merchants of the island innocently understood the words according to their commonly received meaning, and expected an equal share with the whites in the representation of the colony, in the distribution of its offices, and in the civil rights of its inhabitants generally.",3.06,5:3|4:5|3:1|2:4|1:3|total:16,7,1,,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8249259-the-hour-and-the-man-a-historical-romance

24130,6989119,Andiron Tales,John Kendrick Bangs,"Tom was nearly asleep upon that bearskin rug in front of the blazing fire, staring at the two great brazen Andirons that stood in the fireplace. They had big, round, good-natured faces, shining like gold. Their necks were slight and graceful, but as they rounded downward toward handsome feet. They looked very much like a pair of amiable sea serpents.<br /><br />The logs were burning fiercely and at first Tom thought that the words he heard spoken were nothing but their crackling and hissing -- but then the ""Lefthandiron"" -- as Tom's uncle once called it -- winked his eye at Tom!<br /><br />""Hullo, Sleepyhead,"" said the Andiron.<br /><br />Tom returned the wink -- too much surprised to say anything to this inanimate object suddenly coming to life!<br /><br />John Kendrick Bangs (1862-1922) has earned comparison with Mark Twain and L.

24135,91563,The Measure of a Man: A Spiritual Autobiography,Sidney Poitier,"In this luminous memoir, a true American icon looks back on his celebrated life and career.  His body of work is arguable the most morally significant in cinematic history, and the power and influence of that work are indicative of the character of the man behind the many storied roles. Here, Sidney Poitier explores these elements of character and personal values to take his own measure - as a man, as a husband, and father, and as an actor.<p>Poitier was uncompromising as he pursued a personal and public life that would honor his upbringing and the invaluable legacy of his parents. Committed to the notion that what one does for a living articulates who one is, Poitier played only forceful and affecting characters who said something positive, useful, and lasting about the human condition.</p><p>Here, finally, is Poitier's own introspective look at what has informed his performances and his life. Poitier explores the nature of sacrifice and commitment, pride and humility, rage and forgiveness, and paying the price for artistic integrity. What emerges is a picture of a man seeking truth, passion, and balance in the face of limits his own and the world's. A triumph of the spirit, <i>The Measure of a Man</i> captures the essential Poitier.</p><p>Author Biography: Sidney Poitier was the first and remains the only African American actor to win the Academy Award for Best Actor for his outstanding performance in <i>Lilies of the Field</i> in 1963, but he believes that will soon change, given the excellence of African-American talent in the industry today. He has starred in over forty films, directed nine, and written four. His landmark films include <i>TheDefiant Ones, A Patch of Blue, Guess Who's Coming to Dinner,</i> and <i>To Sir, With Love.</i> Among his many accolades, he has recently been selected as the thirty-sixth recipient of the Screen Actors Guild's highest honor, the Life Achievement Award for an outstanding career and humanitarian accomplishment.</p>",3.71,5:2545|4:3273|3:2710|2:870|1:293|total:9691,8988,923,243,HarperOne,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,0061357901,9780061357909,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/91563.The_Measure_of_a_Man

24137,36188910,新譯東京夢華錄,孟元老,The Eastern Capital: A Dream of Splendour / by Mêng Yüen-lao (孟元老)<br /><br />叢書系列：古籍今注新譯叢書／地志類<br /><br />《東京夢華錄》可說是一本「文字版的清明上河圖」，所記為宋徽宗時期北宋都城東京開封的方方面面，描繪其間上至王公貴族、下及庶民百姓的日常生活情景，是研究北宋都市社會生活、經濟文化的重要歷史文獻。本書正文以黃丕烈舊藏元刊明印本為底本，參校其他善本，改正部分訛誤，注釋、語譯則吸取近年相關研究的最新成果，並在「研析」中對於內文的重要章節，從歷史、文化等方面作了評說，是愛好民俗學、風俗學、歷史學的讀者不容錯過的佳作。<br /><br />-作者簡介-<br />嚴文儒 (注譯者)：<br />華東師範大學古籍研究所教授<br /><br />-序-<br />導讀(節選)<br />《東京夢華錄》所記大多是宋徽宗崇寧到宣和（一一○二～一一二五）年間北宋都城東京開封的情況，大致包括這幾方面的內容：京城的外城、內城及河道橋梁、皇宮內外官署衙門的分布及位置、城內的街巷坊市、店鋪酒樓，朝廷朝會、郊祭大典，東京的民風習俗、時令節日，當時的飲食起居、歌舞百戲等等，幾乎無所不包。與同時代的畫家張擇端所作的「清明上河圖」一樣，為我們描繪了這一歷史時期居住在東京的上至王公貴族、下及庶民百姓的日常生活情景，是研究北宋都市社會生活、經濟文化的一部極其重要的歷史文獻。<br /><br />《東京夢華錄》開創了以筆記描述城市風土人情、掌故名物的新體裁，為以後反映南宋都城臨安的同類著作如《都城紀勝》、《夢粱錄》、《武林舊事》、《如夢錄》、《續東京夢華錄》等書所沿用。宋以後的文人墨客，在談到北宋晚期東京的掌故時，首先引用的也往往是該書的資料，如趙甡之的《中興遺史》、陳元靚的《歲時廣記》以及陶宗儀的《說郛》等。<br /><br />到了近代，由於《東京夢華錄》所反映的內容具有很高的社會經濟文化史的價值，尤其引起了中外許多從事各種專史研究的學者、專家們的高度重視。例如探討古代的城市建築與管理，有研究者指出，隋唐以前建城多採用住商分離制，也就是住有住坊，商有商市，每個街區皆以高牆圍繞，至夜則閉戶。主要目的是使住商各不干擾，而城市管理或遇到戰爭、火災等都容易控制。但到唐末的長安城已逐漸有所改變，由於城內商用土地不足，住坊內也有破牆開店者，城外更是商業鼎盛，來自四面八方的商貨都在城外開舖營銷。到了北宋，由於商業需求更大，城市住商分離與街坊封閉制度已徹底瓦解，我們從《東京夢華錄》所描述的開封滿城皆商、滿街是店的盛況，可以得到進一步的印證。<br /><br />又如，孟元老還用大量的筆墨，記錄了當時東京民間和宮廷的「百藝」，並闢有「京瓦伎藝」一目，詳述勾欄諸棚的盛況，以及各藝人的專長。對於宮廷教坊、軍籍、男女樂工、騎手、球隊，也作了描繪，特別是春日宮廷女子馬球隊在寶津樓下的獻藝，還有火藥應用於「神鬼」、「啞雜劇」中增加效果等，為中國「百藝」史留下了可貴的記錄。書中關於諸宮調的淵源，諸藝的名稱，講史、小說的分類等，也是研究中國戲曲、小說和雜技史值得參考的資料。<br /><br />-目次-<br />導　讀<br />夢華錄序 一<br />卷　一<br />東都外城 七<br />舊京城 一一<br />河　道 一四<br />大　內 二○<br />內諸司 二九<br />外諸司 三三<br />卷　二<br />御　街 四一<br />宣德樓前省府宮宇 四三<br />朱雀門外街巷 四八<br />州橋夜市 五四<br />東角樓街巷 五八<br />潘樓東街巷 六二<br />酒　樓 六五<br />飲食果子 六九<br />卷　三<br />馬行街北諸醫鋪 七七<br />大內西右掖門外街巷 七九<br />大內前州橋東街巷 八三<br />相國寺內萬姓交易 八六<br />寺東門街巷 九一<br />上清宮 九四<br />馬行街鋪席 九七<br />般載雜賣 一○○<br />都市錢陌 一○四<br />雇覓人力 一○六<br />防　火 一○七<br />天曉諸人入市 一○九<br />諸色雜賣 一一一<br />卷　四<br />軍頭司 一一五<br />皇太子納妃 一二○<br />公主出降 一二一<br />皇后出乘輿 一二四<br />雜　賃 一二六<br />修整雜貨及齋僧請道 一二七<br />筵會假賃 一二八<br />會仙酒樓 一三○<br />食　店 一三二<br />肉　行 一三七<br />餅　店 一三八<br />魚　行 一四○<br />卷　五<br />民　俗 一四三<br />京瓦伎藝 一四七<br />娶　婦 一五二<br />育　子 一六一<br />卷　六<br />正　月 一六五<br />元旦朝會 一六八<br />立　春 一七四<br />元　宵 一七六<br />十四日車駕幸五嶽觀 一八二<br />十五日駕詣上清宮 一八七<br />十六日 一八八<br />收燈都人出城探春 一九六<br />卷　七<br />清明節 二○一<br />三月一日開金明池瓊林苑 二○六<br />駕幸臨水殿觀爭標錫燕 二一二<br />駕幸瓊林苑 二一九<br />駕幸寶津樓宴殿 二二一<br />駕登寶津樓諸軍呈百戲 二二三<br />駕幸射殿射弓 二三四<br />池苑內縱人關撲遊戲 二三六<br />駕回儀衛 二三九<br />卷　八<br />四月八日 二四三<br />端　午 二四六<br />六月六日崔府君生日二十四日神保觀神生日 二四九<br />是月巷陌雜賣 二五二<br />七　夕 二五五<br />中元節 二五九<br />立　秋 二六二<br />秋　社 二六四<br />中　秋 二六六<br />重　陽 二六八<br />卷　九<br />十月一日 二七一<br />天寧節 二七三<br />宰執親王宗室百官入內上壽 二七五<br />立　冬 二九一<br />卷　十<br />冬　至 二九三<br />大禮預教車象 二九五<br />車駕宿大慶殿 二九七<br />駕行儀衛 三○二<br />駕宿太廟奉神主出室 三○六<br />駕詣青城齋宮 三○九<br />駕詣郊壇行禮 三一一<br />郊畢駕回 三一九<br />下　赦 三二一<br />駕還擇日詣諸宮行謝 三二四<br />十二月 三二五<br />除　夕 三二九<br />附　錄<br />東京夢華錄跋　　　　宋　趙師俠 三三三<br />東京夢華錄跋　　　　明　沈士龍 三三四<br />東京夢華錄跋　　　　明　胡震亨 三三五<br />東京夢華錄跋　　　　明　毛晉 三三六<br />蕘圃藏書題識　　　　清　黃丕烈 三三七<br />景印元刊本東京夢華錄解題　　　　日本　靜嘉堂文庫 三四○<br />昭德先生讀書志附志　　　　宋　趙希弁 三四一<br />直齋書錄解題　　　　宋　陳振孫 三四二<br />四庫全書總目提要 三四三<br />讀書敏求記　　　　清　錢曾 三四四<br />涵芬樓燼餘書錄　　　　近人　張元濟 三四五,0.00,5:0|4:0|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:0,0,0,368,三民書局 (San Min Book),zho,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1504658607l/36188910._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1504658607l/36188910._SX50_.jpg,,9789571452128,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36188910

The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV.

Aber ich werde es erfahren, ich fühle, ich werde es bald wissen."" Stefan Zweig beschreibt in seiner Erzählung die Entwicklung des zwölfjährigen Edgar und dessen Verhältnis zu seiner Mutter sowie dem Baron, seinem anfangs väterlichen Freund. Besonders die Doppelmoral der damaligen Zeit, die gesellschaftlichen Standesunterschiede und das Gefühl, ausgenutzt zu werden, machen es dem Jungen schwer, sich zu orientieren. Schließlich muss er sich aber seinen Gefühlen stellen und ihm wird klar, was es bedeutet, der Welt der Erwachsenen anzugehören und deren Geheimnisse zu teilen. Stefan Zweig wurde am 28. November 1881 in Wien geboren. Sein episches Werk machte ihn ebenso berühmt wie seine historischen Miniaturen und die biographischen Arbeiten. Am 23.

Largely self-taught and altogether indifferent to worldly success, Walser wrote a range of short stories, essays and four novels, of which Jakob von Gunten is widely recognized as the finest. It tells the story of a seventeen-year-old runaway from an old family who enrolls in a school for servants. The Institute, run by the domineering Herr Benjamenta and his beautiful but ailing sister, is a deeply mysterious place: the faculty lies asleep in a single room. The students though subject to fierce discipline, come and go at will. Jakob, an irrepressibly subversive presence, keeps a journal in which he records his quirky impressions of the school as well as his own quickly changing enthusiasms and uncertainties, deliberations and dreams. And in the end, as the Institute itself dissolves around him like a dream, he steps out boldly to explore still-unimagined worlds.",3.99,5:1230|4:1291|3:685|2:213|1:55|total:3474,2800,246,176,New York Review Books Classics,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320554619l/513275._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320554619l/513275._SY75_.jpg,0940322218,9780940322219,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/513275.Jakob_von_Gunten

24181,12119172,Sir Gawain and the Green Knight: A Middle-English Arthurian Romance Retold ...,Unknown,"‘Be prepared to perform what you promised, Gawain;<br /> Seek faithfully till you find me …’<br /><br />A New Year’s feast at King Arthur’s court is interrupted by the appearance of a gigantic Green Knight, resplendent on horseback. He challenges any one of Arthur’s men to behead him, provided that if he survives he can return the blow a year later. Sir Gawain accepts the challenge and decapitates the knight – but the mysterious warrior cheats death and vanishes, bearing his head with him. The following winter Gawain sets out to find the Knight in the wild Northern lands and to keep his side of the bargain. One of the great masterpieces of Middle English poetry, <b>Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</b> magically combines elements of fairy tale and heroic sagas with the pageantry, chivalry and courtly love of medieval Romance. Brian Stone’s evocative translation is accompanied by an introduction that examines the Romance genre, and the poem’s epic and pagan sources. This edition also includes essays discussing the central characters and themes, theories about authorship and Arthurian legends, and suggestions for further reading and notes.<br /><br />",3.70,5:11209|4:17150|3:15433|2:4059|1:833|total:48684,9,0,,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,2940020577541,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12119172-sir-gawain-and-the-green-knight

He has been called the ""national"" poet of Greece and was closely associated with the struggle to rid Modern Greece of the ""purist"" language and with political liberalism. He dominated literary life for 30 or more years and greatly influenced the entire political-intellectual climate of his time. Romain Rolland considered him the greatest poet of Europe and he was twice nominated for the Nobel Prize for poetry but never received it. His most important poem The Twelve Words of the Gypsy (1907) is a poetical-philosophical journey. His ""Gypsy"" is a free thinking, intellectual rebel. He is a Greek Gypsy, in a post classical, post-Byzantine Greek world. He explores work, love, art, country, history, religion and science, keenly aware of his roots and of the contradictions between his classical and Christian heritage.",4.00,5:0|4:4|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:4,3,0,156,Dodo Press,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1406561010,9781406561012,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7454401-life-immovable-first-part

24210,1339655,Deerbrook,Harriet Martineau,"When the Ibbotson sisters, Hester and Margaret, arrive at the village of Deerbrook to stay with their cousin Mr. Grey and his wife, speculation is rife that one of them might marry the local apothecary, Edward Hope. Although he is immediately attracted to Margaret, Hope is ultimately persuaded to marry the beautiful Hester and becomes trapped in an unhappy marriage. His troubles are compounded when a malicious village gossip accuses Hope of grave-robbing, threatening his career. A powerful exploration of the nature of ignorance and prejudice, <i>Deerbrook</i> also may be regarded as one of the first Victorian novels of English domestic life.<br /><br />Excerpt:<br />Every town-bred person who travels in a rich country region, knows what it is to see a neat white house planted in a pretty situation, - in a shrubbery, or commanding a sunny common, or nestling between two hills, - and to say to himself, as the carriage sweeps past its gate, ""I should like to live there,"" - ""I could be very happy in that pretty place."" Transient visions pass before his mind's-eye of dewy summer mornings, when the shadows are long on the grass, and of bright autumn afternoons, when it would be luxury to saunter in the neighbouring lanes; and of frosty winter days, when the sun shines in over the laurustinus at the window, while the fire burns with a different light from that which it gives in the dull parlours of a city. <br />Mr. Grey's house had probably been the object of this kind of speculation to one or more persons, three times a week, ever since the stage-coach had begun to pass through Deerbrook. Deerbrook was a rather pretty village, dignified as it was with the woods of a fine park, which formed the back-ground to its best points of view. Of this pretty village, Mr. Grey's was the prettiest house, standing in a field, round which the road swept. There were trees enough about it to shade without darkening it, and the garden and shrubbery behind were evidently of no contemptible extent. The timber and coal yards, and granaries, which stretched down to the river side, were hidden by a nice management of the garden walls, and training of the shrubbery. <br />In the drawing-room of this tempting white house sat Mrs. Grey and her eldest daughter, one spring evening.",3.68,5:61|4:71|3:69|2:19|1:9|total:229,197,22,656,Penguin Classics,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1311647452l/1339655._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1311647452l/1339655._SY75_.jpg,0141439394,9780141439396,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1339655.Deerbrook

Et ce n'est encore la que le prelude des tortures effroyables qu'il vont s'infliger pendant la semaine sainte, ou ils repetent litteralement les differentes phases du martyre de l'Homme-Dieu, jusqu'au crucifiement de l'un ou de plusieurs des leurs, en grande pompe, le vendredi-saint, sur une des collines sacrees, ou l'on a construit des chapelles ou calvaires, et que l'on appelle casas de los penitentes, maisons des penitents. Ces chapelles sont remplies de croix que les penitentes ont trainees ou portees sur leurs epaules depuis nombre d'annees, jusqu'a des distances considerables; et il faut vraiment voir et soulever ces croix, pour se faire une idee de leur grandeur et de leur poids. J'en ai mesure une, par curiosite, qui avait vingt-cinq pieds de long, et qui pesait huit cents livres; les plus petites n'en pesaient pas moins de trois cents; et elles etaient toutes couvertes du sang des pauvres victimes qui s'etaient sacrifiees volontairement, pour l'expiation de leurs peches, jusqu'a souffrir le supplice du Christ. On formait une procession sous la direction d'un chef, qu'on appelait: el hermano mayor et qui exerce l'autorite la plus absolue sur chaque confrerie, et aux sons aigus d'un fifre champetre, on faisait souffrir successivement et litteralement aux victimes toutes les phases de la Passion, y compris le couronnement d'epines, la flagellation et le supplice du calvaire.

Vier Wochen lang wandert er von Göttingen über Goslar und den Brocken bis nach Ilsenburg und wieder zurück. 1826 veröffentlicht er in seinem ersten ""Reisebild"" eine Beschreibung dieser Harzreise und schafft mit dem Werk den literarischen Durchbruch. Auf meisterliche Weise vermischt Heine die Beschreibung der Natur mit satirischer Gesellschaftskritik. Heiter humoristisch setzt er sich mit den aktuellen politischen und literarischen Verhältnissen in Deutschland auseinander. Unnachahmlich erzählt er spöttisch und feinsinnig von den elementaren Dingen des Lebens: von Essen und Trinken, Frauen und Politik und von seinen Befindlichkeiten als Dichter - alles wird von seiner Feder kommentiert.",3.64,5:71|4:122|3:103|2:35|1:6|total:337,236,6,,,ger,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,3150022215,9783150022214,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1384608.Die_Harzreise

Ismail inventa un supplice digne de lui: il avait fait elever au milieu de la place publique de Miquenez des poutres de dix-huit a vingt pieds de hauteur, armees de gros crampons de fer, auxquels il faisait accrocher ces malheureux qui mouraient ainsi dans d'horribles tortures. XI. LE PAL. En Turquie, on empale les assassins. Ce supplice s'execute en faisant entrer une broche de bois par le fondement. Pour empaler un miserable, on le couche ventre a terre, les mains liees sur le dos; on lui endosse le bat d'un ane sur lequel s'assied un valet du bourreau afin de l'empecher de bouger; un autre lui applique le visage contre terre en lui mettant les mains autour du cou; un troisieme enfonce le pal, enduit de graisse. Ce pieu est taille en pointe, mais un peu arrondi par le bout. Le bourreau le pousse tant qu'il peut par les mains, puis avec un maillet, de maniere a enfoncer les entrailles. Alors le pal est releve droit; le poids du corps fait entrer de plus en plus profondement l'horrible instrument, qui ressort par l'aisselle ou la poitrine. XII. PILE DANS UN MORTIER. Ce supplice, qui n'a pas besoin d'explication, a ete applique au philosophe Anaxarque par le tyran Nicocreon. XIII. LA BROCHE. Dans le royaume de Juda, on punit l'adultere en attachant l'amant a une broche de fer; on le fait rotir, tandis que sa complice, presente a cette execution, est inondee d'eau bouillante. En Russie, avant l'abolition de la question, le prevenu d'un crime etait attache a une broche; on le presentait ainsi a un grand feu et, tandis que son dos brulait, on l'interrogeait. XIV.

24277,1558276,Encyclopedia of Card Tricks,Jean Hugard,"In the first decades of the twentieth century magicians filled the magic journals with articles on card tricks, giving improvements on classic tricks and inventing new ones. If you could put together a collection of these magazines you would have almost a complete course on card tricks, by some of the world's greatest magicians. But where could you find these journals now that they are probably collector's items? And even if you could find them, how much would such a collection cost? Not very much. Because all the best of these tricks are available in this one monumental book, containing nearly every practical card trick produced, invented, and improved by magicians over a span of forty years and more. <br />A truly staggering collection, this book explains how to perform over 600 professional card tricks: impromptu card tricks, spelling tricks, ""you do as I do"" tricks, diachylon (a paste for gluing cards together) tricks, calculation tricks; tricks using key cards, slick cards, double-backed cards, reversed cards, short cards; tricks based on a one-way pack, prearranged pack, Svengali pack, Mene-Tekel pack, stripper pack; special packs; miscellaneous tricks including Everywhere and Nowhere, The Case of the Four Kings, Card in the Orange, The Buddha Whispers, and Inseparable Aces; and a final chapter on tricks using the famous Nikola Card System. In addition, a chapter on technique explains the most important sleights ― the overhand shuffle, riffle shuffle, false cut, palm, simple pass, double lift, glide, and force. <br />Based on a volume compiled by Dr. Wilhelm Von Deusen and Glenn G. Gravatt, this collection was thoroughly revised by Jean Hugard and completely rewritten. It is easily the finest single compendium of classic card tricks, and the clear style makes the instructions easy to follow. An indispensable book for the professional or amateur magician, it is a magnificent source for anyone who wants just the right tricks to mystify his friends or delight his children.",4.17,5:38|4:27|3:13|2:1|1:3|total:82,67,4,416,Dover Publications,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,0486212521,9780486212524,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1558276.Encyclopedia_of_Card_Tricks

But it's not only humans that are open to corruption. The rules have been broken and the simple game has turned into a battle for survival. Who are they Why are they here?

24328,19077085,The Basis of Early Christian Theism,Lawrence Thomas Cole,"In 1898 Lawrence Cole submitted The Basis of Early Christian Theism as partial fulfillment for the requirements for a PhD in Philosophy at Columbia University. Theism is a doctrine concerning the nature of God and his relationship to the universe. God is seen as personal and active in the organization of the Universe. Cole begins by saying, ""In accounts of the theistic argument, as in the history of philosophy in general, it has been customary to pass over a space of well-nigh ten centuries of the Christian era in silence, or with such scanty and unsympathetic notice as to make silence the better alternative. Largely through the influence of such treatment as this, we moderns have almost forgotten at times that during this period there lived men inferior to none in history in endowments of mind and influence on succeeding generations, and that there then took place some of the most significant and far-reaching intellectual conflicts in the history of thought.""",3.00,5:0|4:1|3:2|2:1|1:0|total:4,4,0,,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19077085-the-basis-of-early-christian-theism

How the book came to be written is as follows: The boy, whose two years' narrative forms the subject of these pages, was at the age of sixteen seized with inflammation of the lungs, from which he was recovering so slowly and unsatisfactorily, that I was advised by London physicians to take him from the business he was then learning in Yorkshire, and send him on a long sea voyage.

Any other woman would have panicked during a rescue, but the wily dancer kept her cool—even after being kidnapped by an elusive human trafficker. And Gray couldn’t be happier when a grateful Allye follows him home to Colorado Springs…<br /><br />For Allye, finding sanctuary in the arms—and bed—of the former Navy SEAL is only temporary. People are disappearing off the streets of San Francisco, victims of the same underground trade that targeted her, and Allye could be the key to dismantling the entire operation. She’s willing to do anything to bring them down. Gray isn’t—for good reason. But you don’t say no to a tough girl like Allye who refuses to play it safe.<br /><br />Now Gray is risking more than ever before. The Mountain Mercenaries have his back. But is it enough to keep the woman he loves out of harm’s way?",4.19,5:2641|4:1835|3:759|2:207|1:129|total:5571,5432,558,263,,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1524351769l/37646585._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1524351769l/37646585._SY75_.jpg,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37646585-defending-allye

24372,29378,Practical Ethics,Peter Singer,"Peter Singer's remarkably clear and comprehensive Practical Ethics has become a classic introduction to applied ethics since its publication in 1979 and has been translated into many languages. For this second edition the author has revised all the existing chapters, added two new ones, and updated the bibliography. He has also added an appendix describing some of the deep misunderstanding of, and consequent violent reaction to, the book in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland where the book has tested the limits of freedom of speech. The focus of the book is the application of ethics to difficult and controversial social questions: equality and discrimination by race, sex, ability, or species; abortion, euthanasia, and embryo experimentation; the moral status of animals; political violence and civil disobedience; overseas aid and the obligation to assist others; responsibility for the environment; the treatment of refugees. Singer explains and assesses relevant arguments in a perspicuous, non-doctrinaire way. He structures the book to show how contemporary controversies often have deep philosophical roots; and he presents an ethical theory of his own that can be applied consistently and convincingly to all the practical cases. The book's primary readership remains teachers and students of ethics whether in philosophy or some other branch of the humanities or social sciences. However, such is the clarity of the book's style and structure that it should interest any thinking person concerned with the most difficult social problems facing us as we approach the twenty-first century.",4.06,5:890|4:987|3:413|2:117|1:35|total:2442,1976,76,411,Cambridge University Press,eng,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,052143971X,9780521439718,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29378.Practical_Ethics

24394,12931,Gossamer,Lois Lowry,"Where do dreams come from? What stealthy nighttime messengers are the guardians of our most deeply hidden hopes and our half-forgotten fears? Drawing on her rich imagination, two-time Newbery winner Lois Lowry confronts these questions and explores the conflicts between the gentle bits and pieces of the past that come to life in dream, and the darker horrors that find their form in nightmare. In a haunting story that tiptoes between reality and imagination, two people—a lonely, sensitive woman and a damaged, angry boy—face their own histories and discover what they can be to one another, renewed by the strength that comes from a tiny, caring creature they will never see.<br /><br />Gossamer is perfect for readers not quite ready for Lois Lowry's Newbery-Award winner The Giver and also for readers interested in dreams, nightmares, spirits and the dream world.",3.89,5:4614|4:5308|3:3680|2:839|1:268|total:14709,13628,1543,144,HMH Books for Young Readers,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1410801709l/12931._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1410801709l/12931._SY75_.jpg,0618685502,9780618685509,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12931.Gossamer

Her non-gifted mother has been as supportive as possible, consulting Sophie's estranged father—an elusive European warlock—only when necessary. But when Sophie attracts too much human attention for a prom-night spell gone horribly wrong, it's her dad who decides her punishment: exile to Hex Hall, an isolated reform school for wayward Prodigium, a.k.a. witches, faeries, and shapeshifters. <p>By the end of her first day among fellow freak-teens, Sophie has quite a scorecard: three powerful enemies who look like supermodels, a futile crush on a gorgeous warlock, a creepy tag-along ghost, and a new roommate who happens to be the most hated person and only vampire student on campus. Worse, Sophie soon learns that a mysterious predator has been attacking students, and her only friend is the number-one suspect. </p><p>As a series of blood-curdling mysteries starts to converge, Sophie prepares for the biggest threat of all: an ancient secret society determined to destroy all Prodigium, especially her.</p>",3.95,5:44636|4:42539|3:27187|2:7111|1:3173|total:124646,118763,7111,323,Hyperion Book CH,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1368393885l/5287473._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1368393885l/5287473._SY75_.jpg,1423121309,9781423121305,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5287473-hex-hall

(Francis Cowley) Burnand STRAY THOUGHTS ON PLAY-WRITING. From the Common-place Book of The O'Wilde.-The play? Oh, the play be zephyr'd! The play is not the thing. In other words, the play is nothing. Point is to prepare immense assortment of entirely irrelevant epigrams. ""Epigram, my dear Duke, is the refuge of the dullard, who imagines that he obtains truth by inverting a truism."" That sounds well; must lay it by for use. Take ""Virtue,"" for instance. ""Virtue"" offers a fine field for paradox, brought strictly up to date. Must jot down stray thoughts. (Good idea in the expression ""Stray Thoughts."" Will think over it, and work it up either for impromptu or future play.) Here are a few examples: - (1) Be virtuous, and you will be a County Councillor. (2) Nothing is so dull as a life of virtue-except a career of vice. (3) ""Virtue, my dear Lady Chillingham, is the weakness of the masses, acting under the force of their circumstances."" (4) Virtue, no doubt, is a necessity; but, to be necessary, is the first step to abolition. (5) If you wish to become virtuous, you have only to be found out. (6) There is nothing a man resents so much as the imputation of virtue. (7) Virtue, my dear Horace, is a quality we inculcate upon our wives mainly by a lack of example. (8) I want to be rich merely in order to have the chance of overcoming the difficulties in the way of being virtuous. Virtue on a pound a week is so easy as to repel all but the indolent and worthless. We are delighted to publish this classic book as part of our extensive Classic Library collection.

""The Pocket Asquith"" is announced, and we are asked to say that the pocket in question is not Mr. Redmond's. The discovery of gold particles in a duck's gizzard has, we are told, caused a rush of mining prospectors to Liberty Township, Ohio. It is expected that the duck will shortly be floated as a limited liability company. The Valuation Department has discovered at Llangammarch Wells, Brecknockshire, 50 acres of land for which no owner can be found. Anyone, therefore, who has lost any land is recommended to communicate at once with the Department. The Astronomer-Royal, in reading his annual report at the Royal Observatory last week, said that the mean temperature of the year 1913 was 50.5 degrees. Seeing that this temperature was one degree above the average for the 70 years ended 1910, we consider that the epithet was undeserved. We hesitate to suggest that The Times is catering for cannibals, but it is certainly curious that a recent issue should have contained the following headlines: - ""Prepared Foods. infants, children &amp; invalids."" By the way, the little essay on ""Foods of Antiquity"" omitted to mention that these may still be picked up by curio-hunters at certain railway buffets.

24460,6261178,Kari the Elephant,Dhan Gopal Mukerji,"Dhan Gopal Mukerji (1890-1936) was the first successful Indian man of letters in the United States. He studied at Duff School, the University of Calcutta, in India, Tokyo University in Japan and at the University of California, Berkeley and Stanford University in the U. S. In 1910 Dhan Gopal's family sent him to Japan to study industrial machinery. Although he was initially fascinated with the positivistic spirit of industrialization, later he became disillusioned by the assembly line method of production. After a short stay in Japan, he boarded a ship for San Francisco, where he looked about for a way to support himself and pay for his college education, and soon lit upon writing. Financial constraints and his political radicalism made him move on to Stanford University, from where he earned a graduate degree in metaphysics in 1914. Around 1916 he wrote Rajani; or, Songs of the Night and Laila Majnu. In the 1920s, Mukerji moved to New York and began his most prolific period of writing. Amongst his other works are Sandhya: Songs of Twilight (1917), Kari the Elephant (1922) and Caste and Outcast (1923).",3.52,5:10|4:14|3:11|2:7|1:2|total:44,27,2,64,Dodo Press,eng,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1409903850,9781409903857,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6261178-kari-the-elephant
24461,18897180,Third class in Indian railways,Mahatma Gandhi,"Before he returned to his native India from South Africa, where he had been working as a lawyer, Mahatma Gandhi-now known as MOHANDAS KARAMCHAND GANDHI (1869-1948), the spiritual leader of the movement for Indian independence and a passionate proponent of civil disobedience as a force for social change-was ejected from the first class cabin of a train, even though he held a valid first class ticket, and was forced to travel in the squalid third class cars. In 1917, after he returned home, Gandhi produced this extraordinary look at the plight of the poor in India, as prismed through the experience of a rail journey from Mumbai to Madras. From the filthy, overcrowded conditions in third class to his philosophical musings on the cures for what ailed the downtrodden of that nation, this brief, vital work offers a remarkable insight into the thinking of one of the 20th century's greatest heroes, and essential background for the acts that made him so powerful and so beloved.",3.59,5:225|4:245|3:294|2:96|1:37|total:897,734,42,,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18897180-third-class-in-indian-railways

24485,5355527,A Floral Fantasy in an Old English Garden,Walter Crane,"Walter Crane (1845-1915) was an English artist. Born in Liverpool, he was part of the Arts and Crafts movement. He produced paintings, illustrations, children's books, ceramic tiles and other decorative arts. In 1862 his picture The Lady of Shalott was exhibited at the Royal Academy, but the Academy steadily refused his maturer work; and after the opening of the Grosvenor Gallery in 1877 he ceased to send pictures to Burlington House. In 1864 he began to illustrate a series of sixpenny toy-books of nursery rhymes in three colours for Edmund Evans. He was allowed more freedom in a series beginning with The Frog Prince (1874) which showed markedly the influence of Japanese art, and of a long visit to Italy following his marriage in 1871. From the early 1880s, Crane was closely associated with the Socialist movement. He provided the weekly cartoons for the Socialist Organs Justice, The Commonweal and The Clarion. One of his last major works would be his Lunettes at the Royal West of England Academy which were painted in 1913.",3.64,5:14|4:10|3:18|2:2|1:3|total:47,32,4,60,Dodo Press,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1409905926,9781409905929,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5355527-a-floral-fantasy-in-an-old-english-garden

24493,3534923,The Boy Who Knew What the Birds Said,Padraic Colum,"Padraic Colum (1881-1972) was an Irish poet, novelist, dramatist, biographer and collector of folklore. He was one of the leading figures of the Celtic Revival. At the age of seventeen, he passed an exam for and was awarded a clerkship in the Irish Railway Clearing House. He stayed in this job until 1903. During this period, Colum started to write and met a number of the leading Irish writers of the time. His earliest published poems appeared in The United Irishman. His first book, Wild Earth (1907) collected many of these poems. In 1911 he founded the short-lived literary journal The Irish Review. In 1914, Colum travelled to the USA where he took up children's writing and published a number of collections of stories for children, beginning with The King of Ireland's Son (1916). In 1922 he started writing novels. Amongst his other works are Three Plays (1916), The Boy Who Knew What the Birds Said (1918), The Children of Odin: The Book of Northern Myths (1920) and The Golden Fleece and the Heroes Who Lived Before Achilles (1921).",4.00,5:10|4:6|3:10|2:0|1:0|total:26,17,2,112,Dodo Press,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1406598674,9781406598674,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3534923-the-boy-who-knew-what-the-birds-said
24494,7551108,The Spirit of Lafayette,James Mott Hallowell,"Lafayette symbolized two great principles of government. First, the right of a people to govern themselves, as opposed to government of the many by a self-appointed few-in other words, democracy as opposed to autocracy. Second, a union of the democracies to insure mutual protection and peace... Before landing in America in 1777 he wrote to his wife: ""I but offer my services to that interesting republic from motives of the purest kind, unmixed with ambition or private views: her happiness and my glory are my only incentives to the task.."". -from The Spirit of Lafayette As France floundered in the later years of the Great War, the pressure on the United States to join the European struggle against tyranny was growing. In 1918, American lawyer James Mott Hallowell published this plea to his countrymen to come to the aid of France, which had done the same for America at her hour of greatest need during the Revolution against Britain. By detailing Lafayette's contribution to the then-new nation's battle for freedom, Hallowell argues that the debt the country incurred at its birth from France was now due, and his impassioned argument was so effective it inspired a 1919 film... and helped contribute to the United States' entry into World War I. OF INTEREST TO: readers of World War I issue, students of French-American diplomacy AUTHOR BIO: JAMES MOTT HALLOWELL (b. 1865) served as assistant attorney general of the state of Massachusetts.

24499,233058,The Green Carnation,Robert Smythe Hichens,"An audacious, comic fantasy, satirizing the ways of society, and parodying the mannerisms of certain popular writers. Gay men in turn-of-the-century Paris wore green carnations in their buttonholes. On a visit to Egypt in the winter of 1893-1894 for his health, Hichens met Lord Alfred Douglas and was introduced by him to Oscar Wilde, who was already the most renowned author of his age. Hichens returned to England and wrote <i>The Green Carnation</i>—epigrammatic and keenly satirical in tone—as a parody of Wilde's style, with Douglas burlesqued as Reggie Hastings and Wilde portrayed as Esme Amarinth. The book was a huge success, and it launched Hichens' fiction-writing career.

It's the 4th of his five ""Christmas Books"", coming after The Cricket on the Hearth, followed by The Haunted Man &amp; the Ghost's Bargain.<br />The setting is an English village that stands on the site of a historic battle. Some characters refer to the battle as a metaphor for the struggles of life, hence the title.<br />Battle is the only one of the five Christmas Books that has no supernatural or explicitly religious elements. (One scene takes place at Christmas time, but it isn't the final scene.) The story bears some resemblance to The Cricket on the Hearth in two aspects: it has a non-urban setting &amp; it's resolved with a romantic twist. It's even less of a social novel than is Cricket. As is typical with Dickens, the ending is a happy one.<br />It's one of Dickens' lesser-known works &amp; has never attained any high level of popularity, a trait it shares among the Christmas Books with The Haunted Man.",3.19,5:94|4:162|3:311|2:159|1:25|total:751,0,0,,,epo,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21280817-la-batalo-de-l-vivo

Golah had the wisdom to wield it with effect; for by it, with the assistance of two striplings, he easily controlled those who, under other circumstances, would have claimed the right to be free. Chapter Forty Six. An unjust Reward. The next morning on resuming the journey Golah condescended to tell his captives that they should reach a well or spring that afternoon, and stay by it for two or three days. This news was conveyed to Harry by the Krooman; and all were elated at the prospect of rest, with a plentiful supply of water. Harry had a long conversation with the Krooman as they were pursuing their route. The latter expressed his surprise that the white captives were so contented to go on in the course in which the sheik was conducting them. This was a subject about which Harry and his companions had given themselves no concern; partly because they had no idea that Golah was intending to make a very long journey, and partly because they supposed his intentions, whatever they were, could not be changed by anything they might propose. The Krooman thought different. He told Harry that the route they were following, if continued, would lead them far into the interior of the country, probably to Timbuctoo; and that Golah should be entreated to take them to some port on the coast, where they might be ransomed by an English consul. Harry perceived the truth of these suggestions; and, after having a conversation with his companions, it was determined between them that they should have a talk with Golah that very night. The Krooman promised to act as interpreter, and to do all in his power to favour their suit. He might persuade the sheik to change his destination, by telling him that he would find a far better market in taking them to some place where vessels arrive and depart, than by carrying them into the interior of the country.

24507,916438,Christianity as Mystical Fact: And the Mysteries of Antiquity (Cw 8),Rudolf Steiner,"<b>Written 1902 (CW 8)</b><br /><br />""Because of his sense of the interconnectedness of the spiritual world with nature, art, medicine, and all the rest of life, Rudolf Steiner was a profound polymath. In his seminal study <i>Christianity as Mystical Fact</i> he turned his esoteric genius to interpreting the Christ event as the turning point in the world's spiritual history--an incarnation whose significance he saw transcending all religions."" --<b>Bishop Frederick H. Borsch, </b> professor of New Testament and chair of Anglican Studies, Lutheran Theological Seminary, Philadelphia<br />""As simultaneously mysticism and fact, Christianity is a breakthrough in the historical development of humanity for which the mysteries, with the results that they brought about, form a prior evolutionary stage."" --<b>Rudolf Steiner</b> <br /><br />During the fall and winter of 1901-1902, Steiner gave a series of lectures called ""Christianity As Mystical Fact"" to members of the Theosophical Society. The lectures were rewritten and issued as a book later that year. They mark a watershed in the development of Western esotericism. Steiner wrote of the idea behind his book: <br /><br />""The title <i>Christianity As Mystical Fact</i> was one I gave to this work eight years ago, when I gathered together the content of lectures given in 1902. It was meant to indicate the special approach adopted in the book. Its theme is not just the mystical side of Christianity in a historical presentation. It was meant to show, from the standpoint of a mystical awareness, how Christianity came into being. <br /><br />Behind this was the idea that spiritual happenings were factors in the emergence of Christianity, which could only be observed from such a point of view. It is for the book itself to demonstrate that, by ""mystical,"" I do not in any way imply a vague intuition rather than strict scientific argument. In many circles, mysticism is understood as just that, and therefore it is distinguished from the concerns of all 'genuine' science. <br /><br />""In this book, however, I use the term to mean a 'presentation of spiritual reality'--a reality accessible only to a knowledge drawn from the sources of spiritual life itself. Anyone who denies the possibility of such knowledge in principle will find its contents hard to comprehend; any reader who accepts the idea that mysticism may coexist with the clarity of the natural sciences, may acknowledge that the mystical aspect of Christianity must be described mystically."" <br /><br />This is a fundamental book, in Steiner's own development, in that of Western esotericism, and for our understanding of the Christ event. Readers will find the evolutionary development from the ancient Mysteries through the great Greek philosophers to the events portrayed in the Gospels. <br /><br />Included are an informative introduction and annotated notes by Andrew Welburn and an afterword by Michael Debus, a priest of the Christian Community, who summarizes the book and places it in context. <br /><br /><b>Contents: </b> <br /><br /> Introduction by Christopher Bamford Translator's Preface by Andrew Welburn The Mysteries and Mysteriosophy The Mysteries and Pre-Socratic Philosophy Platonic Mysteries Myth and Mysteriosophy The Egyptian and Other Eastern Mysteries The Evidence of the Gospels The ""Miracle"" of Lazarus The Apocalypse of John Jesus in His Historical Setting The Essence of Christianity Christian and Pagan Wisdom Augustine and the Church Original Prefaces and Additional Materials Afterword by Michael Debus Translator's Notes <br />This <b>Collected Works</b> edition contains a new introduction, a chronology of Rudolf Steiner's life, and an index. <b>German edition: </b> �Das Christentum als mystische Tatsache und die Mysterien des Altertum� <br /><br />Cover image: Photo of Bordeaux Cathedral by James Nicholls.",4.27,5:54|4:33|3:19|2:3|1:0|total:109,85,7,240,Steiner Books,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,0880104368,9780880104364,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/916438.Christianity_as_Mystical_Fact

24516,35588967,The Crystal Hunters a Boy's Adventures in the Higher Alps,Frederic William Burton,"Chapter One. Two Men and a Boy. ""Steady there! Stop! Hold hard!"" ""What's the matter, Mr Dale?"" ""Matter, Saxe, my boy? Well, this. I undertook to take you back to your father and mother some day, sound in wind and limb; but if you begin like that, the trip's over, and we shall have to start back for England in less than a week-at least, I shall, with my luggage increased by a case containing broken boy."" There was a loud burst of hearty laughter from the manly-looking lad addressed, as he stood, with his hands clinging and his head twisted round, to look back: for he had spread-eagled himself against a nearly perpendicular scarp of rock which he had begun to climb, so as to reach a patch of wild rhododendrons. There was another personage present, in the shape of a sturdy, muscular-looking man, whose swarthy face was sheltered by a wide-brimmed soft felt hat, very much turned up at the sides, and in whose broad band was stuck a tuft of the pale grey, starry-looking, downy plant known as the Edelweiss. His jacket was of dark, exceedingly threadbare velvet; breeches of the same; and he wore gaiters and heavily nailed lace-up boots; his whole aspect having evoked the remarks, when he presented himself at the door of the chalet: ""I say, Mr Dale, look here! Where is his organ and his monkey? This chap has been asking for you-for Herr Richard Dale, of London."" ""Yes, I sent for him. It is the man I am anxious to engage for our guide."" For Melchior Staffeln certainly did look a good deal like one of the ""musicians"" who infest London streets with ""kists o' whustles,"" as the Scottish gentleman dubbed them-or much noisier but less penetrating instruments on wheels. He was now standing wearing a kind of baldric across his chest, in the shape of a coil of new soft rope, from which he rarely parted, whatever the journey he was about to make, and leaning on what, at first sight, seemed to be a stout walking-stick with a crutch handle, but a second glance revealed as an ice-axe, with, a strong spike at one end, and a head of sharp-edged and finely pointed steel, which Saxe said made it look like a young pick-axe. This individual had wrinkled his face up so much that his eyes were nearly closed, and his shoulders were shaking as he leaned upon the ice-axe, and indulged in a long, hearty, nearly silent laugh. ""Ah! it's no laughing matter, Melchior,"" said the broad-shouldered, bluff, sturdy-looking Englishman. ""I don't want to begin with an accident."" ""No, no,"" said the guide, whose English seemed to grow clearer as they became more intimate. ""No accidents. It is the Swiss mountain air getting into his young blood. In another week he will bound along the matt, or dash over the green alp like a goat, and in a fortnight be ready to climb a spitz like a chamois."" ""Yes, that's all very well, my man; but I prefer a steady walk. Look here, Saxe!"" ""I'm listening, Mr Dale,"" said the lad. ""Then just get it into your brain, if you can, that we are not out on a schoolboy trip, but upon the borders of new, almost untried ground, and we shall soon be mounting places that are either dangerous or safe as you conduct yourself."" ""All right, Mr Dale; I'll be careful,"" said the lad....",0.00,5:0|4:0|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:0,0,0,,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1499239605l/35588967._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1499239605l/35588967._SX50_.jpg,1548372765,9781548372767,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35588967-the-crystal-hunters-a-boy-s-adventures-in-the-higher-alps

24532,35808889,"Journeys Through Bookland, Vol. 8",Charles Herbert Sylvester,"RINGROSE AND HIS BUCCANEERS Just two days after we took possession of the town of Santa Maria, we departed thence on Saturday, April 17th, 1680. We all embarked in thirty-five canoes, which we had taken while lying at anchor at the front of the town. Thus we sailed, or rather rowed, down the river in quest of the South Sea upon which Panama is seated. Our prisoners, the Spaniards, begged very earnestly that they might be permitted to go with us and not be left to the mercy of the Indians, who would show them no favor and whose cruelty they so much feared, but we had such difficulty in finding boats for ourselves that we could assist them little. However, they found soon after either logs or old canoes, so that they were able to come along with us. It was my misfortune to have a canoe which was very heavy and consequently sluggish. Because of this we were left behind the rest a little way, there being only four men beside myself in the boat. As the tide fell it left several shoals of sand naked, and hence we, not knowing the location of the channel amongst such a variety of streams, steered for over two miles into a shoal where we were forced to lie by until high water came. As soon as the tide began to turn, we rowed away, but in spite of all our endeavors, we could neither find nor overtake our companions. At ten o'clock, when the tide became low, we stuck an oar in the sands and by turns slept in our canoe, where we were pierced to the skin by the showers that fell in the night. The next morning, as soon as the day had come, we rowed away down the river in pursuit of our people, and after going about two leagues we were so fortunate as to overtake them at an Indian landing place, where they had been taking in water. They told us that we would not find water again for six days, and that we must without fail fill our jars. Although we made what haste we could, by the time our jars were filled our friends had all departed and were already out of sight. Such is the nature of the pirates; they care not in the least whom they lose or leave behind. We rowed after them as fast as we possibly could, but all in vain, for here in the mouth of the river the islands were so numerous that it was very easy for us to lose them a second time. After much trouble and toil we did at last find the mouth of the river, but here the tide was again coming in, so that though we were within a stone's throw from the mouth of the river, we could not go through it, but were forced to put ashore and wait for better water. Accordingly we hauled our canoe close by the bushes and fastened it to a tree which the tide had almost covered. WE ROWED AWAY DOWN THE RIVER IN PURSUIT As soon as the tide began to turn, we rowed away again, crossing the Gulf of Miguel. Here we had a very hard time fighting the waves, which dashed against our canoe and might easily have filled and overwhelmed it, for the boat was nearly twenty feet long and not over one and a half broad where it was widest. At dark we landed on an island where we had the most sorrowful resting place I ever experienced in my whole life....",0.00,5:0|4:0|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:0,0,0,,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1548072389,9781548072384,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35808889-journeys-through-bookland-vol-8

With Cami on the high seas investigating the ship from which Roger disappeared, Stuart stays tied to his computer, locked in a battle of wits and technology against an unusually twisted adversary. Aided by Frigg, an artificial intelligence companion of his own creation, the killer targets victims who have lost parents to suicide and attempts to drive them to the same tragic end.<br /><br /> When the heartless killer and his cyber accomplice set their sights on Stuart, High Noon must race against time to save him and countless others.",4.00,5:1346|4:1606|3:848|2:165|1:51|total:4016,2387,336,337,Gallery Books,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1489922695l/30753774._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1489922695l/30753774._SY75_.jpg,1501110802,9781501110801,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30753774-man-overboard

24590,6904088,The Tale of Ferdinand Frog,Arthur Scott Bailey,"Arthur Scott Bailey (1877-1949) was author of more than forty children's books. Bailey attended St. Albans Academy and graduated in 1896, in a class of only eleven other students. He then went on to the University of Vermont in Burlington, Vermont, where he became involved in a fraternal organization, Sigma Phi.

THE CARAVAN. INTRODUCTION. IN a beautiful distant kingdom, of which there is a saying, that the sun on its everlasting green gardens never goes down, ruled, from the beginning of time even to the present day, Queen Phantasie. With full hands, she used to distribute for many hundred years, the abundance of her blessings among her subjects, and was beloved and respected by all who knew her. The heart of the Queen, however, was too great to allow her to stop at her own land with her charities; she herself, in the royal attire of her everlasting youth and beauty, descended upon the earth; for she had heard that there men lived, who passed their lives in sorrowful seriousness, in the midst of care and toil. Unto these she had sent the finest gifts out of her kingdom, and ever since the beauteous Queen came through the fields of earth, men were merry at their labor, and happy in their seriousness. Her children, moreover, not less fair and lovely than their royal mother, she had sent forth to bring happiness to men. One day M�rchen[A], the eldest daughter of the Queen, came back in haste from the earth. The mother observed that M�rchen was sorrowful; yes, at times it would seem to her as if her eyes would be consumed by weeping. ""What is the matter with thee, beloved M�rchen?"" said the Queen to her. ""Ever since thy journey, thou art so sorrowful and dejected; wilt thou not confide to thy mother what ails thee?"" ""Ah! dear mother,"" answered M�rchen, ""I would have kept silence, had I not known that my sorrow is thine also."" ""Speak, my daughter!"" entreated the fair Queen. ""Grief is a stone, which presses down him who bears it alone, but two draw it lightly out of the way.""",0.00,5:0|4:0|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:0,0,0,114,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1727605721,9781727605723,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43111434-the-oriental-story-book

Expense was with him no object. The coming of the holidays had turned his thoughts backward to the care-free days of boyhood and he longed for the holidaying provender of his youth with a longing that was as wide as a river and as deep as a well. ""Me, I have tried it all,"" he said to himself. ""I have been down the line on this eating proposition from alphabet soup to animal crackers. I know the whole thing, from the nine-dollar, nine-course banquet, with every course bathed freely in the same kind of sauce and tasting exactly like all the other courses, to the quick lunch, where the only difference between clear soup and beef broth is that if you want the beef broth the waiter sticks his thumb into the clear soup and brings it along. ""I have feasted copiously at grand hotels where they charge you corkage on your own hot-water bottle, and I have dallied frugally with the forty-cent table d'hote with wine, when the victuals were the product of the well-known Sam Brothers--Flot and Jet--and the wine tasted like the stuff that was left over from graining the woodwork for a mahogany finish.""",3.25,5:0|4:1|3:3|2:0|1:0|total:4,3,2,,,eng,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6514634-cobb-s-bill-of-fare

24604,2022160,Renée Mauperin,Edmond de Goncourt,"The partnership of Edmond and Jules de Goncourt is probably the most curious and perfect example of collaboration recorded in literary history. The brothers worked together for twenty-two years, and the amalgam of their diverse talents was so complete that, were it not for the information given by the survivor, it would be difficult to guess what each brought to the work which bears their names. Even in the light of these confidences, it is no easy matter to attempt to separate or disengage their literary personalities. The two are practically one. <i>Jamais âme pareille n'a été mise en deux corps.</i> This testimony is their own, and their testimony is true. The result is the more perplexing when we remember that these two brothers were, so to say, men of different races. The elder was a German from Lorraine, the younger was an inveterate Latin Parisian: ""the most absolute difference of temperaments, tastes, and characters?and absolutely the same ideas, the same personal likes and dislikes, the same intellectual vision."" There may be, as there probably always will be, two opinions as to the value of their writings; there can be no difference of view concerning their intense devotion to literature, their unhesitating rejection of all that might distract them from their vocation. They spent a small fortune in collecting materials for works that were not to find two hundred readers; they passed months, and more months, in tedious researches the results of which were condensed into a single page; they resigned most of life's pleasures and all its joys to dedicate themselves totally to the office of their election. So they lived?toiling, endeavouring, undismayed, confident in their integrity and genius, unrewarded by one accepted triumph, uncheered by a single frank success or even by any considerable recognition. The younger Goncourt died of his failure before he was forty; the elder underwent almost the same monotony of defeat during nearly thirty years of life that remained to him. But both continued undaunted, and, if we consider what manner of men they were and how dear fame was to them, the constancy of their ambition becomes all the more admirable. <p></p> <p>Edmond de Goncourt</p> <p></p> <p>Despising, or affecting to despise, the general verdict of their contemporaries, they loved to declare that they wrote for their own personal pleasure, for an audience of a dozen friends, or for the delight of a distant posterity; and, when the absence of all appreciation momentarily weighed them down, they vainly imagined that the acquisition of a new <i>bibelot</i> consoled them. No doubt the passion of the collector was strong in them: so strong that Edmond half forgot his grief for his brother and his terror of the Commune in the pursuit of first editions: so strong that the chances of a Prussian bomb shattering his storehouse of treasures?the <i>Maison d'un artiste</i>?at Auteuil saddened him more than the dismemberment of France. But, even so, the idea that the Goncourts could in any circumstances subordinate literature to any other interest was the merest illusion. Nothing in the world pleased them half so well as the sight of their own words in print. The arrival of a set of proof-sheets on the 1st of January was to them the best possible augury for the new year; the sight of their names on the placards outside the theatres and the booksellers' shops enraptured them; and Edmond, then well on in years, confesses that he thrice stole downstairs, half-clad, in the March dawn, to make sure that the opening chapters of <i>Ch?rie</i> were really inserted in the <i>Gaulois</i>. These were their few rewards, their only victories. They were fain to be content with such small things?<i>la petite monnaie de la gloire</i>.</p>",3.26,5:1|4:12|3:7|2:7|1:0|total:27,12,2,,,fre,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,3150086256,9783150086254,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2022160.Ren_e_Mauperin

24624,29330474,Romeo Y Julieta: Mejor Novela de Romance,William Shakespeare,"Eterno simbolo del amor que brota incontenible contra toda fuerza opuesta, Romeo y Julieta dramatiza una leyenda popularizada en el Renacimiento por incontables relatos italianos, franceses e ingleses, en prosa y verso, pero que apenas seria hoy recordada si no hubiera inspirado esta primera gran pieza teatral de Shakespeare, donde resabios de la lucha feudal y destellos comicos de sirvientes y camaradas se entremezclan magistralmente con el mas bello canto al amor. Romeo y Julieta es una de las obras mas populares de Shakespeare; la desgraciada historia de los amantes de Verona ha trascendido la literatura para situarse en el terreno de lo legendario y de lo mitico. En medio de la lucha entre familias rivales, dos personajes juveniles viven un amor tan apasionado como imposible. La reconciliacion llegara tarde, cuando ya se ha consumado la tragedia. La traicion, la lealtad, el odio, los celos, la pasion, son algunos de los temas que William Shakespeare llevo a las tablas permitiendo a sus personajes la libertad de elegir entre los caminos posibles, para luego atenerse a las consecuencias de su proceder. Escrita en cinco actos, Romeo y Julieta expresa de modo insuperable el mito del amor romantico arque tipico en la civilizacion moderna.""",3.74,5:562697|4:589003|3:509379|2:172277|1:66709|total:1900065,38,0,168,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1557690107l/29330474._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1557690107l/29330474._SX50_.jpg,1530107644,9781530107643,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29330474-romeo-y-julieta

24639,21244802,"The Colonial Mortuary Bard; 'Reo, The Fisherman; and The Black Bream Of Australia 1901",Louis Becke,"George Lewis/Louis Becke (1848-1913) was an Australian short-story writer and novelist. He began his voyages in the south seas at a very early age and there are two accounts of these beginnings: one by the Earl of Pembroke, who presumably obtained his information from Becke, which is prefixed to By Reef and Palm (1894), and the other written by Becke. It is difficult to reconcile them, and all that is certain is that Becke spent many years on vessels trading in the Pacific islands. Becke went to London, and he remained in Europe for about 15 years, during which time a large number of collections of short stories and a few novels and stories for boys were published. He was fairly paid by the magazines for his stories, but he always sold his books outright. About 30 of Becke's books are listed in Miller's Australian Literature with six other volumes written in collaboration with W. J. Jeffery. Among Becke's books are: The Naval Pioneers of Australia (1899), and By Rock and Pool on an Austral Shore and Other Stories (1901).",0.00,5:0|4:0|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:0,0,0,,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21244802-the-colonial-mortuary-bard-reo-the-fisherman-and-the-black-bream-of

24650,1671556,The Gentle Art of Making Enemies,James McNeill Whistler,"Whistler's <i>Gentle Art,</i> a classic in the literature of insult and denigration, might well be subtitled ""The Autobiography of a Hater,"" for it contains the deadly sarcasm and stinging remarks of one of the wittiest men of the nineteenth century. Whistler not only refused to tolerate misunderstanding by critics and the so-called art-loving public — but launched vicious counterattacks as well. His celebrated passages-at-arms with Oscar Wilde and Swinburne, the terse and penetrating ""letters to the editor,"" his rebuttals to attacks from critics, and biting marginal notes to contemptuous comments on his paintings and hostile reviews (which are also reprinted) are all part of this record of the artist's vendettas.<br /><br />Whistler's most famous battle began when critic John Ruskin saw one of the artist's ""Nocturnes"" exhibited in Grosvenor Gallery. ""I have seen, and heard,"" wrote Ruskin, ""much of cockney impudence before now; but never expected to hear a coxcomb ask two hundred guineas for flinging a pot of paint in the public's face."" Whistler was incensed with this criticism, and initiated the famous libel case ""Whistler vs. Ruskin."" Extracts from the resultant trial record are among the highlights of this book, with Whistler brilliantly annihilating his Philistine critics, but winning only a farthing in damages.<br /><br /><i>The Gentle Art,</i> designed by Whistler himself, is a highly entertaining account of personal revenges, but it is also an iconoclast's plea for a new and better attitude toward painting. As a historical document, it is the best statement of the new aesthetics versus the old guard academics, and it helped greatly in shaping the modern feeling toward art.<br />",3.92,5:38|4:49|3:34|2:7|1:0|total:128,104,19,334,Dover Publications,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1380034372l/1671556._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1380034372l/1671556._SX50_.jpg,0486218759,9780486218755,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1671556.The_Gentle_Art_of_Making_Enemies
24651,18607035,Old Times at Otterbourne,Charlotte Mary Yonge,"Charlotte Mary Yonge (1823-1901), was an English novelist, known for her huge output. She was devoted to the Church of England, and much influenced by John Keble, a near neighbour and one of the leaders of the Oxford Movement. Her novels reflected the values and concerns of Anglo-Catholicism. She began writing in 1848, and published during her long life about 100 works, chiefly novels. Her first commercial success, The Heir of Redclyffe (1854), provided the funding to enable the schooner Southern Cross to be put into service on behalf of George Selwyn. Similar charitable works were done with the profits from later novels. She was also editor, for nearly forty years, of a magazine for young ladies, the Monthly Packet. Among the best known of her works are Heartsease; or, The Brother's Wife (1854), The Daisy Chain; or, Aspirations (1856), A History of Christian Names (1863, revised 1884), A Book of Golden Deeds (1864), The Dove in the Eagle's Nest (1866), Life of John Coleridge Patteson: Missionary Bishop of the Melanesian Islands (1873) and Hannah More (1888).",3.67,5:0|4:2|3:1|2:0|1:0|total:3,3,1,,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18607035-old-times-at-otterbourne

24655,2649321,Tinker's Dam,Robyn G. Wall,"People admired and envied Ted Wilson. In many ways, he reflected the personal qualities of his mother, particularly her caring and selfless nature, and her clear sense of moral values. Ted was the friend whom others relied on, a role model for kindness, wisdom, and reason. Yet there was one person in Tedas circle of friends who neither embraced nor celebrated those personal qualities. Tinker Stanley was a cynical and self-serving person who considered Tedas idealistic values and naAve world view to be personal liabilities. Tinkeras Dam addresses the inherent tensions and conflicts in this unlikely friendship as it follows Tedas life from age eleven to age forty. It is a story about the quest for self-acceptance and personal redemption. At times heartwarming and at other times tragic, it is a familiar story that all people, in varying degrees, can identify with.",5.00,5:1|4:0|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:1,1,0,260,America Star Books,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1424155932,9781424155934,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2649321-tinker-s-dam

24672,6593575,Where the God of Love Hangs Out,Amy Bloom,"Love, in its many forms and complexities, weaves through this collection by Amy Bloom, the New York Times bestselling author of Away. Bloom's astonishing and astute new work of connected stories illuminates the mysteries of passion, family, and friendship.Propelled by Bloom's dazzling prose, unmistakable voice, and generous wit, Where the God of Love Hangs Out takes us to the margins and the centers of real people's lives, exploring the changes that love and loss create. A young woman is haunted by her roommate's murder; a man and his daughter-in-law confess their sins in the unlikeliest of places. In one quartet of interlocking stories, two middle-aged friends, married to others, find themselves surprisingly drawn to each other, risking all while never underestimating the cost. In another linked set of stories, we follow mother and son for thirty years as their small and uncertain family becomes an irresistible tribe. Insightful, sensuous, and heartbreaking, these stories of passion and disappointment, life and death, capture deep human truths. As The New Yorker has said, ?Amy Bloom gets more meaning into individual sentences than most authors manage in whole books.?",3.53,5:512|4:1067|3:920|2:329|1:104|total:2932,2632,458,201,,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320514157l/6593575._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320514157l/6593575._SY75_.jpg,1400063574,9781400063574,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6593575-where-the-god-of-love-hangs-out

24699,10029815,Some Personal Recollections of Dr. Janeway,James Bayard Clark,"Edward Gamaliel Janeway (1841-1911) was an American physician and author. He was graduated from Rutgers College in 1860, receiving the degree of B. A. and M. A. from that institution. In 1864 he was graduated from the College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York, receiving the degree of M. D. Later in life, the degree of LL.

While in the medical school in the years 1862 and 1863, he was made acting medical cadet in the United States Army hospitals at Newark, New Jersey. He began to practise medicine in New York City where he continued and ended his professional career. In 1869, he became professor of pathology and practical anatomy in Bellevue Hospital Medical College, continuing in that capacity until 1876.

A Patron, he has everything a boy could possibly want—the latest tech, the coolest clothes, and a Proxy to take all his punishments. When Knox breaks a vase, Syd is beaten. When Knox plays a practical joke, Syd is forced to haul rocks. And when Knox crashes a car, killing one of his friends, Syd is branded and sentenced to death.<br /><br />Syd is a Proxy. His life is not his own.<br /><br />Then again, neither is Knox’s. Knox and Syd have more in common than either would guess. So when Knox and Syd realize that the only way to beat the system is to save each other, they flee. Yet Knox’s father is no ordinary Patron, and Syd is no ordinary Proxy. The ensuing cross-country chase will uncover a secret society of rebels, test both boys’ resolve, and shine a blinding light onto a world of those who owe and those who pay.

24709,194739,Blue Bamboo: Japanese Tales of Fantasy,Osamu Dazai,"<i>Blue Bamboo</i> is a collection of seven short stories by one of Japan's preeminent postwar writers and prose stylists, Osamu Dazai. Not the typical romantic fantasies so often seen in Japanese writing, filled with water sprites and vengeful ghosts, these stories are a mixture of fantastic allegory, slightly skewed fables, and affecting romantic tales. Revealing the wide range of Dazai's imaginative powers, they also give a glimpse of his humane and idealistic side. <br /><br />From the title story, about an impoverished, henpecked scholar who is transformed by the love of a voluptuous bird, to ""The Chrysanthemum Spirit,"" about a passionate gardener who meets a brother and sister with extraordinary powers, Dazai creates a world of fantasy and romance that is infused with his own psychological concerns. Many readers may recall the poignancy of Oscar Wilde's <i>The Happy Prince</i> or Han Christian Andersen. <br /><br />The collection is capped by two delightful stories-within-a-story, in which the assorted members of a quirky family compose alternate episodes of a slightly gothic romance with hints of Poe and Saki (in ""On Love and Beauty"") and a wildly elaborate retelling of Rapunzel that is engaging, horrifying, and touching by turns (in ""Lanterns of Romance""). <br /><br />All in all, these warm, inventive, and life-affirming stories will strike a deep, satisfying chord in many readers.",4.02,5:165|4:189|3:109|2:16|1:5|total:484,396,39,184,Kodansha,eng,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,4770026102,9784770026101,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/194739.Blue_Bamboo

24713,839727,Stories of New Jersey,Frank R. Stockton,"Frank R. Stockton's stories recreate the events and moods of New Jersey from the days of the Lenni-Lenape Indians and the Dutch colonists to the expolits of New Jerseyans in the Mexican War. Here are the colorful historical and legendary figures of New Jersey's past: colonials who fought, traded with, and were captured by Indians; the perpetrators of New Jersey's own Tea Party; revolutionary heroes and heroines; frontiersmen, early inventors, schoolmasters, doctors, and privateersmen. Some of their stories have been told many times, but rarely as well. These tales are reproduced exactly as they first appeared in 1896, in a book which remained in print until 1945 and which has remained so popular over the years that it has in itself become a part of New Jersey's history. The book's turn-of-the-century flavor is enhanced by many illustrations, including drawings by twenty-one artists that provide realistic detail in the style of a bygone era.<br />",4.00,5:17|4:15|3:11|2:3|1:0|total:46,28,9,272,Rutgers University Press,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,0813503698,9780813503691,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/839727.Stories_of_New_Jersey

Sagarra, amb la seva habilitat per treballar la psicologia dels seus personatges, els descriu a la perfecció, dotant-los d’una gran tendresa; el resultat de les seves descripcions és un retrat acurat i precís d’aquesta burgesia barcelonina, d’origen menestral, que si pot viure amb certes comoditats no és tant pels diners que guanya sinó per la mesura amb què els gasta.",3.50,5:0|4:3|3:3|2:0|1:0|total:6,5,1,234,Editorial Laia,cat,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1471857743l/2424916._SY160_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1471857743l/2424916._SY75_.jpg,8472228193,9788472228191,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2424916.Paulina_Buxareu

It went on to win the Pulitzer Prize in 1961 and was later made into an Academy Award-winning film, also a classic.<br /><br />Compassionate, dramatic, and deeply moving, To Kill A Mockingbird takes readers to the roots of human behavior - to innocence and experience, kindness and cruelty, love and hatred, humor and pathos. Now with over 18 million copies in print and translated into forty languages, this regional story by a young Alabama woman claims universal appeal.

24754,11614146,Wit and Wisdom of Don Quixote,Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra,"Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra (1547-1616) was a Spanish novelist, poet, and playwright. His magnum opus, Don Quixote, is considered a founding classic of Western literature and regularly figures among the best novels ever written. He has been dubbed el Principe de los Ingenios - the Prince of Wits. In 1585, he published a pastoral novel, La Galatea. Because of financial problems, he worked as a purveyor for the Spanish Armada, and later as a tax collector. In 1605 he was in Valladolid, just when the immediate success of the first part of his Don Quixote, published in Madrid, signaled his return to the literary world.

Denney insists ""the death of Christ cannot be understood unless it is seen as a death for sin, as Christ bearing the penalty in the place of those he came to save.""

Many of his visionary tales appeared in magazines such as Pearson's Magazine and Pearson's Weekly before being published as novels.

24769,5987325,The Opal Serpent,Fergus Hume,"Fergusson Wright Hume, known as Fergus Hume (1859-1932) was an English novelist whose family emigrated to New Zealnd when he was three. <br /><br />Shortly after graduation in Otago he left for Melbourne. He began writing plays, but found it impossible to persuade the managers of the Melbourne theatres to accept or even read them. Finding that the novels of Emile Gaboriau were then very popular in Melbourne, he obtained and read a set of them and determined to write a novel of a similar kind. The result was the self-published novel 'The Mystery of a Hansom Cab' (1886), which became a great success. <br /><br />After the success of his first novel and the publication of another he returned to England in 1888. He resided in the Essex countryside for thirty years, eventually producing over 100 novels and short stories. He was a capable writer of mystery stories, and may be looked upon as one of the precursors of the many writers of detective stories whose work was so popular in the twentieth century. <br /><br />His other works include 'Madame Midas' (1888), 'The Silent House in Pimlico' (1899), 'The Bishop's Secret' (1900), 'Secret Passage' (1905), 'The Green Mummy' (1908), and 'Red Money' (1912).",3.66,5:4|4:13|3:10|2:2|1:0|total:29,17,4,,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5987325-the-opal-serpent

In the Roman Empire no one is safe from the sting of betrayal: man, woman or child.<br /><br />As a boy, Nero's royal heritage becomes a threat to his very life, first when the mad emperor Caligula tries to drown him, then when his great aunt attempts to secure her own son's inheritance. Faced with shocking acts of treachery, young Nero is dealt a harsh lesson: it is better to be cruel than dead.<br /><br />While Nero idealizes the artistic and athletic principles of Greece, his very survival rests on his ability to navigate the sea of vipers that is Rome. The most lethal of all is his own mother, a cold-blooded woman whose singular goal is to control the empire. With cunning and poison, the obstacles fall one by one. But as Agrippina's machinations earn her son a title he is both tempted and terrified to assume, Nero's determination to escape her thrall will shape him into the man he was fated to become, an Emperor who became legendary.<br /><br />With impeccable research and captivating prose, <i>The Confessions of Young Nero</i> is the story of a boy's ruthless ascension to the throne. Detailing his journey from innocent youth to infamous ruler, it is an epic tale of the lengths to which man will go in the ultimate quest for power and survival.",3.89,5:566|4:956|3:508|2:108|1:27|total:2165,1651,372,514,Berkley Books,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1488179336l/30687928._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1488179336l/30687928._SY75_.jpg,0451473388,9780451473387,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30687928-the-confessions-of-young-nero

24789,146689,Render Unto Caesar,Gillian Bradshaw,"Hermogenes is a young Greek from Alexandria, heir to a noble and vibrant society. But in his youth Hermogenes and his family were held captive to the whims of the queen Cleopatra, whose machinations spelled doom for an entire nation--whose schemes for empire caused the might of Rome to conquer his people. While the citizens of Rome may ape Hellenic ways, the Alexandrian Greeks are viewed as less than human because they are not of Rome.<br /><br />But a man may win the coveted citizenship in more ways than birth on Roman soil. When Hermogenes father is granted such a boon, it appears as if his family has found favor from the gods--except then a business deal goes sour and Hermogenes father dies at sea. It is left to Hermogenes to reclaim all monies owed to the family... including a debt from a very well connected Roman consul who has reneged on his obligations and refuses to deal with ""Greek trash.""<br /><br />Hermogenes will travel to Rome to reclaim what he is owed and finds it is no simple matter. Along the way, he will encounter base desire and power struggles, plots within plots... and a beautiful woman gladiator who is more than she seems. His life is in danger, and ultimately Hermogenes is left with the question:<br /><br />Can the conferring of a title make one truly Roman? And if not, how far will a man go to satisfy honor?",3.83,5:85|4:170|3:104|2:15|1:5|total:379,321,28,464,Forge Books,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1312067008l/146689._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1312067008l/146689._SY75_.jpg,0765306549,9780765306548,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/146689.Render_Unto_Caesar

He met Darwin in 1874 and became a firm friend and follower, applying Darwinian theory to his work on animal intelligence and mental evolution. Romanes was elected to the Royal Society in 1879 at the age of 31, having produced his own influential research on the evolution of the nervous system. This three-volume study of Darwin's work and its implications was first developed as a series of lectures given in Edinburgh and London between 1886 and 1890. Controversially, Romanes deviates from Darwin's assertion of the significance of geographical isolation, contending that physiological differences among the same species were central to evolutionary change. First published in 1892, Volume 1 focuses on the Darwinian theory itself.

The format consisted of ""Notes"" (miscellaneous thoughts from correspondents that they and the editors considered of interest to the readership), and ""Queries"" (and responses to queries), which formed the bulk of the publication. There were numerous regional versions of Notes and Queries throughout Britain (e. g., Somerset and Dorset Notes and Queries) and three incarnations of American Notes and Queries.

24811,677065,Viking Tales,Jennie Hall,"Nights were long in Iceland winters of long ago. A whole family sat for hours around the fire in the middle of the room. That fire gave the only light. Shadows flitted in the dark corners. Smoke curled along the high beams of the ceiling. The children sat on the dirt floor close by the fire. The grown people were on a long narrow bench that they had pulled up to the light and warmth. Everybody's hands were busy with wool. As the family worked in the red fire-light, the father told of the kings of Norway, of long voyages to strange lands, of good fights. And in farmhouses all through Iceland these old tales were told over and over until everybody knew them and loved them. Men who could sing and play the harp were called ""skalds,"" and they called their songs ""sagas."" Eventually these stories were written down on sheepskin or vellum so that we can enjoy them today. We follow the fortunes of Harald from the time he is acknowledged by his father as a baby and given his own thrall at the cutting of his first tooth, through his exploits as a viking adventurer, to his crowning as King of Norway. It is when Harald is King of Norway that population pressures at home and eagerness for adventure and booty from other lands combine to drive some of the bolder Vikings to set forth from their native land. Sailing ever westward across the Atlantic, they hop along the chain of islands that loosely connects Norway with America-Orkneys and Shetlands, Faeroes, Iceland, and Greenland. It is from link to link of this chain that the characters in our story sail in search of home and adventure. Discoveries are made by accident. Ships are driven by the wind into unknown ports, resulting in landings and settlements in Iceland, Greenland, and America. The crude courage of these men and strangeness of their adventures appeal strongly to children, while their love of truth, hardy endurance, and faithfulness to the promised word make them characters to emulate. Suitable for children ages 9 and up to read to themselves and for children as young as 6 as a read-aloud.",3.82,5:297|4:399|3:280|2:72|1:22|total:1070,526,38,,Yesterday's Classics,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1599150042,9781599150048,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/677065.Viking_Tales

24823,54539,Silas Marner,George Eliot,"George Eliot's tale of a solitary miser gradually redeemed by the joy of fatherhood, <i>Silas Marner</i> is edited with an introduction and notes by David Carroll in Penguin Classics.<br /><br />Wrongly accused of theft and exiled from a religious community many years before, the embittered weaver Silas Marner lives alone in Raveloe, living only for work and his precious hoard of money. But when his money is stolen and an orphaned child finds her way into his house, Silas is given the chance to transform his life. His fate, and that of Eppie, the little girl he adopts, is entwined with Godfrey Cass, son of the village Squire, who, like Silas, is trapped by his past. <i>Silas Marner</i>, George Eliot's favourite of her novels, combines humour, rich symbolism and pointed social criticism to create an unsentimental but affectionate portrait of rural life.<br /><br />This text uses the Cabinet edition, revised by George Eliot in 1878. David Carroll's introduction is complemented by the original Penguin Classics edition introduction by Q.D. Leavis.<br /><br />Mary Ann Evans (1819-80) began her literary career as a translator, and later editor, of the Westminster Review. In 1857, she published <i>Scenes of Clerical Life</i>, the first of eight novels she would publish under the name of 'George Eliot', including <i>The Mill on the Floss</i>, <i>Middlemarch</i>, and <i>Daniel Deronda</i>.<br /><br />If you enjoyed <i>Silas Marner</i>, you might like Nathaniel Hawthorne's <i>The Scarlet Letter</i>, also available in Penguin Classics.<br /><br />'I think <i>Silas Marner</i> holds a higher place than any of the author's works. It is more nearly a masterpiece; it has more of that simple, rounded, consummate aspect ... which marks a classical work'<br />Henry James",3.63,5:16164|4:22658|3:18994|2:6512|1:2901|total:67229,58338,2220,262,Simon  Schuster,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54539.Silas_Marner

Our aim is to provide readers with the highest quality reproductions of fiction and non-fiction literature that has stood the test of time. The many thousands of books in our collection have been sourced from libraries and private collections around the world.The titles that Trieste Publishing has chosen to be part of the collection have been scanned to simulate the original. Our readers see the books the same way that their first readers did decades or a hundred or more years ago. Books from that period are often spoiled by imperfections that did not exist in the original. Imperfections could be in the form of blurred text, photographs, or missing pages. It is highly unlikely that this would occur with one of our books. Our extensive quality control ensures that the readers of Trieste Publishing's books will be delighted with their purchase. Our staff has thoroughly reviewed every page of all the books in the collection, repairing, or if necessary, rejecting titles that are not of the highest quality.

24842,1481832,The Defence of Duffer's Drift,Ernest Dunlop Swinton,"In the 100 years since The Defence of Duffers Drift was first published in Great Britain, the face of modern warfare has changed dramatically. But what have not changed very much are the concepts of small unit tactics: Ground is held, buildings are searched, and individual enemy combatants are killed or captured by men with rifles. And those men are led by NCOs and junior officers.<br /><br />The Defence of Duffers Drift is a fictional account of a young, inexperienced British officer, who is tasked with holding a river crossing with 50 troops against a larger enemy force. His initial failures and eventual victory serve as an entertaining and instructive vehicle to convey the principles of small unit tactics. Because it deals with principles, this definitive work has endured to this day and is still on some of the required reading lists of the U.S. Army and Marine Corps",4.09,5:204|4:233|3:115|2:15|1:2|total:569,310,29,72,Avery,eng,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,0895293234,9780895293237,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1481832.The_Defence_of_Duffer_s_Drift

He gives everyone a unique identity, differentiating them through varying tones, voices, and accents."" --<i> AudioFile</i> Magazine</b><br /><br />Nathaniel Dresden never really got along with his father, an infamous civil rights lawyer who defended criminals and spearheaded protest movements. As an act of rebellion, Natty joined the U.S. Army and served in Iraq, coming back with a chest full of commendations and a head full of disturbing memories.<br /><br />But when his father is found murdered near the peaceful confines of Brooklyn's Prospect Park, Natty is forced to deal with the troubled legacy of their unresolved relationship. He also has to fend off the growing suspicions of NYPD Detective Lourdes Robles, a brash Latina cop with something to prove, who thinks Natty might bear some responsibility for his father's death. Though truth be told, the list of people--cops and criminals--who wanted David Dresden out of the way is long. The search for answers leads Natty and Lourdes into an urban labyrinth where they must confront each other--and the brutal truths that could destroy them both.<br /><br /><i>Proving Ground</i> is Peter Blauner's first audiobook in more than a decade.

24857,35770547,"Journeys Through Bookland, Vol. 10 the Guide",Charles Herbert Sylvester,"Excerpt Introduction Everyone who associates with children becomes deeply interested in them. Their helplessness during their early years appeals warmly to sympathy; their acute desire to learn and their responsiveness to suggestion make teaching a delight; their loyalty and devotion warm the heart and inspire the wish to do the things that count for most. Everything combines to increase a sense of responsibility and to make the elders active in bringing to bear those influences that make for character, power and success. Every worthy teacher in every school gives more than her salary commands and puts heart power into every act. By example and precept the lessons are taught and growth follows in response to cultivation. But the schools are handicapped by lack of time for much personal care, by lack of facilities for the best of instruction and by the multiplicity of things that must be done. Under the best conditions a teacher has but a small part of a child's time and then instruction must be given usually to classes and not to individuals. Outside of school for a considerable time each day the child falls under the influence of playmates who may or may not be helpful, but the greater part of every twenty-four hours belongs to the home. Parents, guardians, brothers and sisters, servants, consciously or unconsciously, wisely or unwisely, are teaching all the time. It is from this great complex of influences that every child builds his character and lays the foundation of whatever success he afterwards achieves. Undoubtedly the home is the greatest single influence and that is strongest during the early years. Before a boy is seven the elements of his character begin to form; by the time he is fourteen his future usually can be predicted, and after he is twenty, few real changes are brought about in the character of the man. The schools can do little more than plant the seeds of culture; in the family must the young plants be watered, nourished and trained. Then will the growth be symmetrical and beautiful. When the school and the home work together, when parents and teacher are in hearty sympathy, the great work is easily accomplished. But this harmony in interest is difficult to secure. In the first place it is not possible frequently for parents and teachers to become acquainted; usually is it impossible for them to know one another intimately. Here there are two forces, each ignorant of the other, but both trying for a common end. Again, parents in many, many instances are not acquainted with the schools nor with the methods of instruction which are followed therein. What is done by one may be undone by the other. If there could be a common ground of meeting, much labor would be saved and greater harmony of effort established. When fathers and mothers are willing to take time enough from their other duties to show that sympathetic interest in juvenile tasks which is the greatest stimulus to intelligent effort, when they wish to know what work each child is doing and where in each text book his lessons are, when the multiplication table and the story of Cinderella are of as much importance as the price of meat or the profit on a yard of silk, then will the parents and the teachers come together in whatever field appears mutually acceptable....",0.00,5:0|4:0|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:0,0,0,,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,154819624X,9781548196240,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35770547-journeys-through-bookland-vol-10-the-guide
