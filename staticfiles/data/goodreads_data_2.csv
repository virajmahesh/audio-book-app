30000,19427104,The Bird Book Illustrating in natural colors more than seven hundred North American birds; also several hundred photographs of their nests and eggs.,Chester A. Reed,"Chester A. Reed knows birds. He studied them for thirty years in the hand for plumage, and in their haunts for habits. He studied them in their homes and photographed hundreds of them as they were actually feeding their young. Besides being able to write about these things in an interesting and instructive manner, he is classed as one of the foremost bird artists in America. This rare combination of Artist/Author/Naturalist produced the ultimate bird book. This book might well be called an illustrated dictionary of North American birds. In this facsimile edition you will find more than seven hundred birds illustrated, along with hundreds of photographs of their nests and eggs. This wonderful guide gives you the information you need to make a quick identification of any bird you are likely to meet, as well as a plethora of information about it and its haunts.

En realite, le programme de l'emancipation feminine, que nous etudierons, article par article, suivant l'ordre dans lequel nous venons de l'enoncer, peut se ramener, pour plus de clarte, a deux directions generales qui correspondent a nos deux series d'etudes. Dans la premiere, la femme poursuit: 1 son emancipation individuelle, en reclamant une plus large et plus libre accession aux lumieres de la science; 2 son emancipation sociale, en revendiquant une plus large et plus libre admission aux metiers et professions des hommes. Dans la seconde, la femme entend realiser: 1 son emancipation politique, en conquerant le droit de suffrage; 2 son emancipation familiale, en obtenant au foyer plus d'independance et d'autorite. Ainsi donc, d'une part, droits de la femme en matiere d'instruction et de travail: voila pour son emancipation individuelle et sociale; d'autre part, droits de la femme dans les affaires de l'Etat et du menage: voila pour son emancipation politique et familiale.""",0.00,5:0|4:0|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:0,0,0,508,Omnia Veritas Ltd,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1910220779,9781910220771,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27758718-le-feminisme-francais-i---l-emancipation-individuelle-et-sociale-de-la-f

It was a fine game. The one I was attacking twisted and spiralled to escape. I got him from behind and forced him to the 500-meter level. I was very close to him and quite surprised that he had stopped his twisting; but just as I was about to give him the finishing shots, my machine gun stopped. I had pressed down too hard on the trigger Pg 108 mechanism, in the heat of the battle, and this had jammed. The second Frenchman now attacked me, and I escaped while I could. The second fight took place over our lines. The first Frenchman, as I learned later, had gotten his share. He was just able to glide to the French side of the Meuse, and here he landed, according to some reports; others say he fell. I am inclined to believe the former, but probably he could not pick a good spot in which to land, and so broke his machine. From Lieutenant R. I heard that the machine, as well as an automobile, that came to its aid, were set afire by our artillery. I learned further details from Lieutenant B. After landing, one of the Pg 109 aviators ran to the village, returned with a stretcher and helped carry the other one away. Things seem to have happened like this: I wounded the pilot; he was just able to make a landing; then, with the aid of his observer, he was carried off, and our artillery destroyed his machine. On the following day, the 13th, there was again great aerial activity. Early in the morning I came just in time to see a French battleplane attack a German above Fort Douaumont. I went for the Frenchman and chased him away",3.92,5:3|4:6|3:2|2:1|1:0|total:12,8,1,24,Rarebooksclub.com,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1381287814l/8275680._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1381287814l/8275680._SX50_.jpg,1153823330,9781153823333,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8275680-an-aviator-s-field-book-being-the-field-reports-of-oswald-bolcke-from-a

Their manufacture was one of the earliest incentives for the blending of colors in such harmony as to please the eye and satisfy the mind; consequently, it is one of the most important of the industrial arts. Since the days when ancient peoples first lay down to sleep wrapped in the skins of animals, the human intelligence has quickened, and as the race has become more civilized, rugs have gradually taken the place of skins. Thus began the industry of rug-weaving, and it has grown to such an extent that it is now of world-wide importance. The word Rug is used in this volume in the follow ing sense A covering for the ﬂoor; a mat, usually oblong or square, and woven in one piece.

30029,294304,Lost in Translation,Nicole Mones,"A novel of searing intelligence and startling originality, <i>Lost in Translation</i> heralds the debut of a unique new voice on the literary landscape.  Nicole Mones creates an unforgettable story of love and desire, of family ties and human conflict, and of one woman's struggle to lose herself in a foreign land--only to discover her home, her heart, herself.<br /><br />At dawn in Beijing, Alice Mannegan pedals a bicycle through the deserted streets.  An American by birth, a translator by profession, she spends her nights in Beijing's smoke-filled bars, and the Chinese men she so desires never misunderstand her intentions.  All around her rushes the air of China, the scent of history and change, of a world where she has come to escape her father's love and her own pain.  It is a world in which, each night as she slips from her hotel, she hopes to lose herself forever.<br /><br />For Alice, it began with a phone call from an American archaeologist seeking a translator.  And it ended in an intoxicating journey of the heart--one that would plunge her into a nation's past, and into some of the most rarely glimpsed regions of China.  Hired by an archaeologist searching for the bones of Peking Man, Alice joins an expedition that penetrates a vast, uncharted land and brings Professor Lin Shiyang into her life.  As they draw closer to unearthing the secret of Peking Man, as the group's every move is followed, their every whisper recorded, Alice and Lin find shelter in each other, slowly putting to rest the ghosts of their pasts.  What happens between them becomes one of the most breathtakingly erotic love stories in recent fiction.  Indeed, <i>Lost in Translation</i> is a novel about love--between a nation and its past, between a man and a memory, between a father and a daughter.  Its powerful impact confirms the extraordinary gifts of a master storyteller, Nicole Mones.",3.65,5:360|4:785|3:634|2:147|1:43|total:1969,1800,238,384,Delta,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320424335l/294304._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320424335l/294304._SY75_.jpg,0385319444,9780385319447,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/294304.Lost_in_Translation

Determined to bring as much value as she can on the auction block, but inexperienced where men are concerned, she asks the handsome pirate if he’ll teach her how to pleasure a man. Intrigued, and more than a little attracted to the lavender-eyed beauty, Slayter agrees. As he initiates her into the world of bondage, spanking and out-of-this-galaxy sex, though, both Teyla and Slayter find themselves falling for each other.<br /><br />But Slayter has a responsibility to his crew, and Teyla knows it is her duty to pay off her family’s debt.

In Oran, a coastal town in North Africa, the plague begins as a series of portents, unheeded by the people. It gradually becomes an omnipresent reality, obliterating all traces of the past and driving its victims to almost unearthly extremes of suffering, madness, and compassion.",3.98,5:44870|4:53628|3:28612|2:6927|1:1887|total:135924,111537,2768,308,Vintage International,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1503362434l/11989._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1503362434l/11989._SY75_.jpg,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11989.The_Plague
30063,30164,"Double Take (FBI Thriller, #11)",Catherine Coulter,"It's been more than six months since her husband's brutal death, and Julia Ransom is just beginning to breathe again. She loved her husband, renowned psychic August Ransom, but the media frenzy that followed his murder sapped what little strength she had left. Now, after dinner with friends, strolling along San Francisco's Pier 39, she realizes that she's happy. Standing at the railing, she savors the sounds around her-tourists, seals on a barge-and for a moment enjoys the sheer normalcy of it all. And then it comes to an end. <br /><br /> Out of nowhere she's approached by a respectable-looking man who distracts her with conversation before violently attacking her and throwing her the railing. If it hadn't been for Special Agent Cheney Stone, out to stretch his legs between courses at a local restaurant, Julia would have vanished into the bay's murky depths. Not only does he save her from a watery grave, but he senses a connection between her assault and her husband's death, and sets out to serve as her protector while reopening August Ransom's murder investigation. <br /><br /> Meanwhile, in Maestro, Virginia, Sheriff Dixon Noble-last seen in <i>Point Blank</i>-still mourns his wife, Christie, who vanished hree years earlier. His life, too, is just getting back to normal when he learns of a San Francisco woman named Charlotte Pallack, whose shocking resemblance to Christie sends Dix across the country. Though he knows in his heart that she can't possibly be his wife, Dix is compelled to see her with his own eyes. Once in San Francisco, Dix and Cheney's paths inevitably cross. With the help of agents Dillon Savich and Lacey Sherlock, whose San Francisco connections prove essential in unlocking the mystery behind Charlotte Pallack's identity as well as the forces behind Julia Ransom's attempted murder, Sheriff Noble and Agent Stone push deep into a complex world of psychics and poseurs. As the stakes and the body count rise, Savich, Sherlock, Dix, and Cheney fight for answers-and their lives.",4.05,5:2993|4:3285|3:1772|2:310|1:70|total:8430,7364,364,420,Putnam Adult,eng,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,0399154248,9780399154249,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30164.Double_Take

Boken skrevs under Strindbergs vistelse i Schweiz och södra Tyskland. De inledande raderna har blivit mycket berömda, så kallad in medias res: ""Han kom som ett yrväder en aprilafton och hade ett höganäskrus i en svångrem om halsen.""<br /><br />Hemsöborna följer fastlänningen Carlsson som kommer till Hemsö för att hjälpa till med änkan Flods lantbruk. Det skär sig snabbt mellan Carlsson och Flods son Gusten, som tycker att Carlsson är högfärdig. Carlsson får dock ordning på lantbruket och han får idén att hyra ut ett av husen till en professorsfamilj under sommaren, vilket ger hushållet extrapengar. Carlsson förälskar sig i Ida, en av pigorna från Stockholm, men sin uppvaktning har han inget för, och nästa sommar gifter sig Carlsson med madam Flod. Den äkta sängen har dock inte mycket att erbjuda och Flod förstår snart att Carlsson är närgången mot pigorna. Hon smyger efter Carlsson en vinternatt och drar på sig lunginflammation. Under julen dör hon och när kistan ska föras till kyrkan går isen upp, kistan sjunker och Carlsson förmodas drunkna.",3.35,5:224|4:559|3:619|2:237|1:85|total:1724,1432,26,197,Natur & Kultur,swe,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1334942552l/1808775._SY160_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1334942552l/1808775._SY75_.jpg,9127052273,9789127052277,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1808775.Hems_borna

30096,8486803,The Camera Fiend,E.W. Hornung,"Ernest William Hornung (1866-1921) was an English author. He spent most of his life in England and France, but in 1884 left for Australia and stayed for two years. Although his Australian experience had been so short, it coloured most of his literary work from A Bride from the Bush (1890), to Old Offenders and a Few Old Scores (1923) which appeared after his death. He published the poems Bond and Free and Wooden Crosses in The Times. The character of A. J.

30100,30959635,"Emma, by: Jane Austen, A NOVEL about youthful hubris and the perils of misconstrued romance (Original Version)",Jane Austen,"Emma, by Jane Austen, is a novel about youthful hubris and the perils of misconstrued romance. The novel was first published in December 1815. As in her other novels, Austen explores the concerns and difficulties of genteel women living in Georgian-Regency England; she also creates a lively comedy of manners among her characters. Before she began the novel, Austen wrote, ""I am going to take a heroine whom no one but myself will much like."" In the first sentence she introduces the title character as ""Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich."" Emma is spoiled, headstrong, and self-satisfied; she greatly overestimates her own matchmaking abilities; she is blind to the dangers of meddling in other people's lives; and her imagination and perceptions often lead her astray. This novel has been adapted for several films, many television programs, and a long list of stage plays.Emma Woodhouse has just attended the wedding of Miss Taylor, her friend and former governess, to Mr Weston. Having introduced them, Emma takes credit for their marriage, and decides that she likes matchmaking. After she returns home to Hartfield with her father, Emma forges ahead with her new interest against the advice of Mr Knightley and tries to match her new friend Harriet Smith to Mr Elton, the local vicar. First, Emma must persuade Harriet to refuse the marriage proposal from Robert Martin, a respectable, educated, and well-spoken young farmer, which Harriet does against her own wishes. But Mr Elton, a social climber, thinks Emma is in love with him and proposes to her. When Emma tells him that she had thought him attached to Harriet, he is outraged. After Emma rejects him, Mr Elton leaves for a stay at Bath and returns with a pretentious, nouveau-riche wife, as Mr Knightley expected. Harriet is heartbroken and Emma feels ashamed about misleading her. Frank Churchill, Mr Weston's son, arrives for a two-week visit to his father and makes many friends. Mr Knightley suggests to Emma that while Frank is clever and engaging, he is also a shallow character. Jane Fairfax comes home to see her aunt, Miss Bates, and grandmother, Mrs Bates, for a few months, before she must go out on her own as a governess. She is the same age as Emma, but Emma has not been as friendly with her as she might. Emma envies her talent and is annoyed to find all, including Mrs Weston and Mr Knightley, praising Jane. The patronising Mrs Elton takes Jane under her wing and announces that she will find her the ideal governess post before it is wanted. Emma begins to feel some sympathy for Jane's predicament. Emma decides that Jane and Mr Dixon are mutually attracted, and that is why she has come home. She shares her suspicions with Frank, who met Jane and the Campbells at a vacation spot a year earlier, and he apparently agrees with her. Suspicions are further fueled when a piano, sent by an anonymous benefactor, arrives for Jane. Emma feels herself falling in love with Frank, but it does not last to his second visit. The Eltons treat Harriet badly, culminating with Mr Elton publicly snubbing Harriet at the ball given by the Westons in May. Mr Knightley, who had long refrained from dancing, gallantly steps in to dance with Harriet. The day after the ball, Frank brings Harriet to Hartfield, she having fainted after a rough encounter with local gypsies. Harriet is grateful, and Emma thinks this is love, not gratitude. Meanwhile, Mrs Weston wonders if Mr Knightley has taken a fancy to Jane but Emma dismisses that idea. When Mr Knightley mentions the links he sees between Jane and Frank, Emma denies them, while Frank appears to be courting her instead. He arrives late to the gathering at Donwell in June, while Jane leaves early. Next day at Box Hill, a local beauty spot, Frank and Emma continue to banter together and Emma insults Miss Bates.",4.00,5:214757|4:206539|3:117122|2:29803|1:13463|total:581684,23,1,226,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1486420466l/30959635._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1486420466l/30959635._SY75_.jpg,1534929517,9781534929517,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30959635-emma-by

It shows him applying his classical economic theory to policy questions of lasting concern: the desirability of sustained growth of national wealth and population, the merits of capitalism versus socialism, and the suitable scope of government intervention in the competitive market economy. His answers to those questions have profound relevance today, and they serve to illustrate the enduring power and imagination of his distinctive liberal utilitarian philosophy. The lucid introduction and explanatory notes clarify Mill's philosophy in relation to his economic theory, and make full use of the most recent scholarship.",3.88,5:92|4:122|3:70|2:26|1:2|total:312,26,0,,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11411705-principles-of-political-economy-abridged-with-critical-bibliographical

Born in Derby, Connecticut, she was an author of dime novels and is credited as the progenitor of that genre. Her work was also serialized in Godey's Lady's Book, The Ladies' Companion, and Graham's Magazine. The term ""dime novel"" originated with Stephens's Malaeska: The Indian Wife of the White Hunter, printed in the first book in Beadle &amp; Adams Beadle's Dime Novels series, dated June 9, 1860. The novel was a reprint of Stephens's earlier serial that appeared in The Ladies' Companion magazine in February, March, and April of 1839. Later, the Grolier Club listed Malaeska as the most influential book of 1860.

30115,2042018,Tante Rosa,Sevgi Soysal,"İletişim Yayınları Sevgi Soysal’ın bütün eserlerini yayımlıyor. İlk kitap Tante Rosa, Sevgi Soysal’ın ölüm yıldönümü olan 22 Kasım’ın haftasında çıktı. 1968’de yayımlandığında, çocukluğu Birinci Dünya Savaşı Almanya’sında geçmiş, Rosa adlı bir kadının hayat hikâyeciklerini içeren bu roman, edebiyat çevrelerini şaşırtmış ancak pek de anlaşılamamış. Sevgi Soysal’ı 12 Mart dönemi edebiyatı yoluyla tanıyan okura ise hiç ulaşamamış. Oysa Tante Rosa, Sevgi Soysal’ı 12 Mart döneminin simge yazarı yapanın yalnızca 12 Mart değil, Tante Rosa’da ilk filizlerini veren cesur bir kadınca duyarlılık olduğunun en güzel ispatı. Bütün Eserleri dizisinde önce kronolojik bir sırayla romanları yayımlanacak Sevgi Soysal’ın. Tante Rosa’dan sonra sırada kadın-erkek ilişkisi ve evlilik temasını işlediği romanı Yürümek var. Soysal bu romanıyla (1970) TRT Sanat Ödülleri Yarışması Başarı Ödülü’nü kazanmış. Ve yine bu romanı nedeniyle müstehcenlik gerekçesiyle yargılanmış. Daha sonra gelen Yenişehir’de Bir Öğle Vakti, özellikle Ankaralı solcuların çok sevdiği, etkilendiği bir roman. Oradaki Ali karakteri, ideal bir devrimci modelidir; bir kuşak onu örnek alarak devrimciliği öğrenir. Bir sonraki romanı Şafak ise Murat Belge’nin sözleriyle “devrimci Türkiye romanı için çok yeni ve çok önemlidir” çünkü “Sevgi Soysal’ın olayların nesnelliği ve insanların öznelliği arasında kurduğu diyalektik ilişki, Marksist bir estetiğin ürünüdür.” Sevgi Soysal, kanser tedavisi için gittiği İngiltere’de “hastalık-tedavi ötesi şeyler yapmaya” çalışır. Burada yazmaya başladığı romanı Hoşgeldin Ölüm yarım kalır. İletişim Yayınları’ndan çıkacak Hoşgeldin Ölüm’ün ardına Sevgi Soysal’la aynı dönemde yaşamış ve yazmış, Attilâ İlhan, Oya Baydar, Tomris Uyar, Adalet Ağaoğlu, Ahmet Oktay ve Vüs’at Bener gibi isimlerin tanıklıkları eklenecek. Hoşgeldin Ölüm, bu haliyle belki de bir hüzün kitabı olacak. Yıldırım Bölge Kadınlar Koğuşu, romanlardan sonra ilk yayımlanacak anı kitabı. Muzip bir dille yazılmış bu anılar, tefrika edilirken bazı solcuların tepkisini çekmiş. Öykü kitabı Barış Adlı Çocuk, 12 Mart öncesini, daha sonraki değişimi ve hastalığı konu ediyor. Yeni Ortam ve Politika gazetelerine yazdığı yazılarının toplandığı Bakmak ise ilk öykü kitabı Tutkulu Perçem’in ardından yayımlanacak. Yıldırım Türker, bu siyasi deneme yazılarının gazete yazarı olmaya kalkmasındaki en önemli neden olduğunu söylüyor. Türker, Sevgi Soysal’ın kendisi için “ilkgençliğinde dünyayla arasına gerili; şefkatle harelenmiş bir zekâ, isyankâr bir neşe, kül yutmaz bir duruştan dokunmuş bir tül” olduğunu yazıyor. Sevgi Soysal’ın İletişim’den çıkacak son eseri ise daha önce yayımlanmamış oyunu Venüslü Kadınlar. Yayına hazırlanan bir diğer kitap da, Sevgi Soysal’ın eserleri üzerine edebiyat eleştirisi ağırlıklı yazılardan oluşan bir derleme. Genç yaşta kaybettiğimiz Sevgi Soysal’ın bütün eserleriyle yeniden gündeme gelmesi, onunla büyümüş bir kuşağın ona borcunu ödemesi, onu tanımadan büyümüş bir kuşak içinse önemli bir fırsattır.<br /><br />Tante Rosa'dan<br /><br />""...Bu işin bir başka işten ne ayrıcalığı var?

30135,20628903,Walter Pieterse-A Story of Holland,Multatuli,"From Preface: ""Most of us know that The Hague is somewhere in Holland; and we all know that Queen Wilhelmina takes a beautiful picture; but to how many of us has it occurred that the land of Spinoza and Rembrandt is still running a literary shop? How many of us have ever heard of Eduard Douwes Dekker? Very few, I fear, except professional critics. And yet, the man who, forty years ago, became famous as Multatuli (I have borne much), was not only the greatest figure in the modern literature of the Netherlands, but one of the most powerful and original writers in the literature of the world. An English critic has called him the Heine of Holland; Anatole France calls him the Voltaire of the Netherlands. Eduard Douwes Dekker was born in 1820, at Amsterdam, his father being the captain of a merchantman trading in the Dutch colonies. At the age of eighteen Dekker sailed on his father’s vessel for the East Indies, determined to abandon the business career that had been mapped out for him and enter the colonial service. In 1839 he received a clerkship in the civil service at Batavia. He now remained in the employ of the government for seventeen years, being promoted from one grade to another until he was made Assistant Resident of Lebak in 1856. In this important position he used his influence to better the condition of the natives; but, to his sorrow, he soon found that he did not have the support of his superiors. What he conceived to be right clashed with the line of conduct he was expected to follow. In a rash moment of “righteous indignation” he handed in his resignation; and it was accepted. This hasty step put an end to a brilliant political career and entailed upon Dekker years of disappointment and hardship. Seeing that he was pursuing the wrong method to help either the Javanese, or himself, he immediately tried to get reinstated, but without success. In 1857 he returned to Holland and applied to the home government, hoping to be vindicated and restored to his post. Again he was disappointed. The government offered him another desirable position; but, as it was a matter of principle with Dekker, he declined it. When he saw that it was useless to importune the government further, Dekker made his appeal to the people in “Max Havelaar” (1860). The book was an instant success and made the name of Multatuli famous. Through the perfidy of a supposed friend, however, Dekker failed to get very substantial material rewards from this work. For ten years yet he was struggling with poverty.""",3.57,5:32|4:70|3:60|2:20|1:4|total:186,1,0,,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20628903-walter-pieterse-a-story-of-holland

Sibling rivalry, the bond between father and son, the excitement – and difficulty -- of fishing all add up to a day of adventure any child would want to experience. <br /><br /> <br />Matthew Cordell illuminates this novel-in-verse throughout with his energetic black-and-white line drawings. <br /><br /> <br />While each poem can be read and enjoyed on its own, the poems work together to create a story arc with conflict, crisis, resolution and character growth.<br /><br /> <br />The back matter of this book equips the reader with a Poet's Tackle Box of tools and definitions for understanding the various poetic forms the author uses in this story.",4.02,5:650|4:573|3:312|2:81|1:45|total:1661,1608,330,128,Houghton Mifflin Books for Children,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348098618l/15752349._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348098618l/15752349._SX50_.jpg,0547820119,9780547820118,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15752349-gone-fishing

30146,10773221,What She Could (1870),Susan Bogert Warner,"Susan Bogert Warner (1819-1885), was an American evangelical writer of religious fiction, children's fiction, and theological works. She wrote, under the name of ""Elizabeth Wetherell, "" thirty novels, many of which went into multiple editions. However, her first novel, The Wide, Wide World (1850), was the most popular. It was translated into several other languages, including: French, German, and Dutch. Other than Uncle Tom's Cabin, it was perhaps the most widely circulated story of American authorship. In the nineteenth-century, critics admired the depictions of rural American life in her early novels. Early twentieth-century critics classified Warner's work as ""sentimental"" and thus lacking in literary value. In the later twentieth century, feminist critics rediscovered The Wide, Wide World, discussing it as a quintessential domestic novel and focusing on analyzing its portrayal of gender dynamics. Some of her works were written jointly with her younger sister Anna Bartlett Warner, who sometimes wrote under the pseudonym ""Amy Lothrop."" Her other works include: Queechy (1852), The Law and the Testimony (1853), The Hills of the Shatemuc (1856), The Old Helmet (1863), and Melbourne House (1864).",4.33,5:5|4:6|3:1|2:0|1:0|total:12,7,0,,,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1408930718l/10773221._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1408930718l/10773221._SX50_.jpg,1437364098,9781437364095,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10773221-what-she-could

It seems that ""14"" is doing away with them one by one.<br /><br />As the annual reunion begins, only 11 members arrive. News comes that three of their group - Morris Miller, August Schurman, and Wrigley, have just died. The ""14"" message arrives soon after.<br /><br />Jimmy Hale, star reporter for the New York Eagle, had been assigned to cover the reunion. He travels to his friend Professor Herman Brierly's nearby camp, and from there they attend the reunion at Higginbotham's camp.

Soon Katharine is locked in a vicious battle with Thomas Cromwell, the Lord Privy Seal, as she fights for political and religious change.<br /><br />Ford saw the past as an integral part of the present experience and understanding, and his sharply etched vision of the court of Henry VIII--first published in 1908--echoes aspects of Edwardian England as it explores the pervading influence of power, lies, fear, and anxiety on people's lives.",3.48,5:16|4:20|3:25|2:7|1:5|total:73,40,7,,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1103814095,9781103814091,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7003691-the-fifth-queen

30194,11697010,Landmarks in the History of Early Christianity,Kirsopp Lake,"Nothing illustrates this so well as the history of Christianity, for no religion is so well-known. The facts are plainly visible, and would be plainly seen by all, were it not for the general tendency of ecclesiastical scholarship to consult the records of the past only to find the reflection of its own features. The general condition of religion in the Roman Empire at the beginning of the Christian era was one of far advanced disintegration and rapid synthesis. In every district there could be found the remains of old local religions, which retained the loyalty of the conservative, but no longer aroused any vital response in the emotions of the multitudes or in the interest of the educated. At that time, and for many generations afterward, the Roman landowners, to take one example, maintained the ceremonies and customs of an agricultural animism which for their ancestors had been a living religion, but for them had become aesthetic, conventional, and superstitious, -an appendage to life, not its driving force. Those who wish can read a description of it, written with a sympathy possible only for one who felt the analogy of his own experience, in the pages of Marius the Epicurean, in which Walter Pater, by a wonderful tour de force, wove an exact and scholarly knowledge of the original documents into such a web of artistic English that the deep learning of the book cannot be appreciated except by those who have some small share in it themselves. Over these local religions had been thrown throughout the Empire the covering fabric of Greek mythology. It had lost much of its power; it was no longer sincerely believed; it was in every respect decadent; but it still played its part in unifying, and to some extent civilising, the diverse races of the Empire. But more important than the Greek mythology was the Greek philosophy, which was indeed in many ways its antidote. If the mythology of Greece appeared to sanction an infinite number of gods and goddesses, her philosophers taught with equal persuasiveness that the divine reality is one, though its forms be many.

Jealous and angry, his brothers nicknamed Joseph ""the dreamer"" and plotted to do away with him as the person who, according to the dream, would one day rule them. When the chance came, they seized him and sold him to some passing traders, who took him to faraway Egypt.<br /><br />Alone and enslaved, Joseph had nothing left but his faith in God and his marvelous ability to tell the meaning of dreams. Through these, he came to be a rich and powerful leader in Egypt. And one day, when their own land was suffering from famine, his brothers came to Egypt in search of food. As in the dream, they bowed down before Joseph. Many years had passed, and they did not know that the great leader was their brother. But Joseph recognized them. Would he choose to punish his brothers or to forgive them?<br /><br />Clyde Robert Bulla retells one of the greatest stories of the Old Testament with dramatic simplicity.

30223,19062609,Bridge Disasters in America The Cause and the Remedy,George L. Vose,"Excerpt from Bridge Disasters in America: The Cause and the Remedy: <i>A few years ago an iron highway bridge at Dixon, III., fell, while a crowd was upon it, and killed sixty persons. The briefest inspection of that bridge by any competent engineer would have been sure to condemn it. A few years later the Ashtabula bridge, upon the Lake Shore Railroad, broke down under a passenger train, and killed from 80 to 100 passengers. The report of the committee of the Ohio Legislature appointed to investigate that disaster concluded, first, that the bridge went down under an ordinary load by reason of defects in its original construction; and, secondly, that the defects in the original construction of the bridge could have been discovered at any time after its erection by careful examination. Hardly had the public recovered from the shock of this terrible disaster when the Tariffville calamity added its list of dead and wounded to the long roll already charged to the ignorance and recklessness which characterizes so much of the management of the public works in this country. <br />There are many bridges now in use upon our railroads in no way better than those at Ashtabula and Tariffville, and which await only the right combination of circumstances to tumble down. There are, by the laws of chance, just so many persons who are going to be killed on those bridges. There are hundreds of highway bridges now in daily use which are in no way safer than the bridge at Dixon was, and which would certainly be condemned by five minutes of competent and honest inspection. More than that, many of them have already been condemned, as unfit for public use, but yet they are allowed to remain, and invite the disaster which is sure to come. Can nothing be done to prevent this reckless and wicked waste of human life?

30225,1040934,House of Many Gods,Kiana Davenport,"From Kiana Davenport, the bestselling author of <i>Song of the Exile</i> and <i>Shark Dialogues</i>, comes another mesmerizing novel about her people and her islands. Told in spellbinding and mythic prose, <i>House of Many Gods</i> is a deeply complex and provocative love story set against the background of Hawaii and Russia. Interwoven throughout with the indelible portrait of a native Hawaiian family struggling against poverty, drug wars, and the increasing military occupation of their sacred lands. <br /><br />Progressing from the 1960s to the turbulent present, the novel begins on the island of O’ahu and centers on Ana, abandoned by her mother as a child. Raised by her extended family on the “lawless” Wai’anae coast, west of Honolulu, Ana, against all odds, becomes a physician. While tending victims of Hurricane ‘Iniki on the neighboring island of Kaua’i, she meets Nikolai, a Russian filmmaker with a violent and tragic past, who can confront reality only through his unique prism of lies. Yet he is dedicated to recording the ecological horrors in his motherland and across the Pacific. <br /><br />As their lives slowly and inextricably intertwine, Ana and Nikolai’s story becomes an odyssey that spans decades and sweeps the reader from rural Hawaii to the forbidding Arctic wastes of Russia; from the poverty-stricken Wai’anae coast to the glittering harshness of “new Moscow” and the haunting, faded beauty of St. Petersburg. With stunning narrative inventiveness, Davenport has created a timeless epic of loss and remembrance, of the search for family and identity, and, ultimately, of the redemptive power of love.",3.97,5:210|4:243|3:133|2:41|1:4|total:631,537,85,352,Ballantine Books,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320497801l/1040934._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320497801l/1040934._SY75_.jpg,0345481518,9780345481511,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1040934.House_of_Many_Gods

What Susan B. Anthony was to women's suffrage and Harriet Beecher Stowe was to the cause of abolition, Clara Barton was to the humanitarian impulse of the American people to help the unfortunate victims of war and disaster. In 1881 Clara Barton founded the American Red Cross; she served as its president from 1882 to 1904. The Red Cross of today stands as a living memorial to the lifelong efforts of this valiant women.<p>Miss Barton tells the story of the first twenty-five yeas of the organization which she founded. The relief offered by the organization in the Texas Famine, the Mount Vernon Cyclone, the Johnstown Flood, the Sea Island Hurricane, and the Galveston Tidal Wave is discussed in detail. The stories become all the more dramatic because they are told in Clara Barton's own words and from her point of view as an eyewitness. She lived much that she did not write, but she wrote nothing that she did not live.</p>",3.31,5:10|4:7|3:24|2:9|1:1|total:51,39,4,,,eng,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11954464-a-story-of-the-red-cross-glimpses-of-field-work

30240,11161887,The Big Trip Up Yonder,Kurt Vonnegut,"The story is set in 2158 A.D., after the invention of a medicine called Anti-Gerasone, which is made from mud and dandelions and is thus inexpensive and widely available. Anti-Gerasone halts the aging process and prevents people from dying of old age as long as they keep taking it; as a result, America now suffers from severe overpopulation and shortages of food and resources. With the exception of the very wealthy, most of the population appears to survive on a diet of foods made from processed seaweed and sawdust. Gramps Ford, his chin resting on his hands, his hands on the crook of his cane, was staring irascibly at the five-foot television screen that dominated the room. On the screen, a news commentator was summarizing the day's happenings. Every thirty seconds or so, Gramps would jab the floor with his cane-tip and shout, ""Hell, we did that a hundred years ago!"" Emerald and Lou, coming in from the balcony, where they had been seeking that 2185 A.D. rarity--privacy--were obliged to take seats in the back row, behind about a dozen relatives with whom they shared the house. All save Gramps, who was somewhat withered and bent, seemed, by pre-anti-gerasone standards, to be about the same age--somewhere in their late twenties or early thirties. Gramps looked older because he had already reached 70 when anti-gerasone was invented. He had not aged in the 102 years since. ""Next one shoots off his big bazoo while the TV's on is gonna find hisself cut off without a dollar--"" his voice suddenly softened and sweetened--""when they wave that checkered flag at the Indianapolis Speedway, and old Gramps gets ready for the Big Trip Up Yonder."" He sniffed sentimentally, while his heirs concentrated desperately on not making the slightest sound. For them, the poignancy of the prospective Big Trip had been dulled somewhat, through having been mentioned by Gramps about once a day for fifty years.",3.63,5:341|4:739|3:777|2:135|1:10|total:2002,1474,92,22,Aegypan,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1606645005,9781606645000,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11161887-the-big-trip-up-yonder

30247,7878702,Mabel's Mistake,Ann Sophia Stephens,"Ann Sophia Stephens (1813-1886), who also wrote under the pseudonym Jonathan Slick, was an American novelist. Born in Derby, Connecticut, she was an author of dime novels and is credited as the progenitor of that genre. Her work was also serialized in Godey's Lady's Book, The Ladies' Companion, and Graham's Magazine. The term ""dime novel"" originated with Stephens's Malaeska: The Indian Wife of the White Hunter, printed in the first book in Beadle &amp; Adams Beadle's Dime Novels series, dated June 9, 1860.

30249,19057172,Ways of Nature,John Burroughs,"John Burroughs (1837-1921) was an American naturalist and essayist. He played an important role in the evolution of the U. S. conservation movement. According to biographers at the American Memory project at the Library of Congress, John Burroughs was the most important practitioner after Thoreau of that especially American literary genre, the nature essay. By the turn of the century he had become a virtual cultural institution in his own right: the Grand Old Man of Nature at a time when the American romance with the idea of nature, and the American conservation movement, had come fully into their own. His extraordinary popularity and popular visibility were sustained by a prolific stream of essay collections, beginning with Wake-Robin in 1871. In the words of his biographer Edward Renehan, Burroughs's special identity was less that of a scientific naturalist than that of ""a literary naturalist with a duty to record his own unique perceptions of the natural world. "" His most famous works include: Winter Sunshine (1875), Locusts and Wild Honey (1879), The Writings of John Burroughs (1895) and Far and Near (1904).",3.62,5:8|4:12|3:15|2:4|1:0|total:39,35,2,,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19057172-ways-of-nature

Berkeley wrote that a large part of the people were so desperately poor that they might reasonably be expected upon any small advantage of the enemy to ""revolt to them in hopes of bettering their Condition by Shareing the Plunder of the Country with them."" 470 A certain John Knight reported ""that the planters there doe generally desire a trade with the Dutch and all other nations and would not be singly bound to the trade of England, and speake openly there that they are in the nature of slaves, soe that the hearts of the greatest part of them are taken away from his Majesty."" 471 Thus the downtrodden planters, alienated from England, angered at the Governor, even distrusting their own Assembly, waited but an occasion and a leader to rise in open rebellion. A new Indian war offered the occasion, and they found their leader in young Nathaniel Bacon. Pg 146 CHAPTER VI Bacon's Rebellion For many years Virginia had been at peace with the neighboring Indians. 472 The long series of wars which had filled most of the first half of the seventeenth century had broken the spirit and power of the Pamunkeys, the Nansemonds and the Nottoways. 473 The remnants of these nations had become dependent upon the English, paying them tribute and looking to them for protection from their enemies. 474 In 1675, however, these friendly relations were disturbed by a southward movement of some of the northern Indians. Large bodies of the warlike Senecas, pressing upon the Susquehannocks at the head of the Chesapeake Bay, were driving them down into Maryland and Virginia. Here their indigence and their restlessness became a menace to the whites and an element of disturbance to their relations with the other tribes. 475 In the summer of 1675 a party of savages rowed across the Potomac river, committed several murders and made good their escape into Maryland. 476 In anger and alarm the planters of Stafford county seized their arms to protect their...",3.33,5:0|4:1|3:2|2:0|1:0|total:3,1,0,106,Rarebooksclub.com,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1381746788l/9715626._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1381746788l/9715626._SX50_.jpg,1153825287,9781153825283,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9715626-virginia-under-the-stuarts-1607-1688

He becomes even more fixated after Kimo poses for an erotic painting called Phantom Lover. He plans to seduce Kimo even though the man is straight, married and known for his extreme loyalty to his wife. <br /> <br />Alone on a hot night after dance rehearsal on the big island of Hawaii, Bobby manages to persuade Kimo to let him service his neglected, extremely hungry passions.

Several descriptions of boiled sugars are sold crystalized, which look very pretty and stand exposure to the atmosphere better. The process is very simple and may be done with little trouble. When the drops have been made and set, break them up and sift them well in a coarse sieve, now shake them over a pan which is boiling, so that they get damped by steam, and throw them in a heap of crystal sugar; mix them well up, so that the sugar adheres to the drops uniformly: now sift them out of the sugar again and they will dry in a few minutes and be ready for packing. Another method is, when the drops have been made and sifted, to have a thin solution of gum or gelatine and shake it over them and rub them all together till damp all over; now throw over them sufficient crystal sugar to coat them and mix them up; when dry sift again and pack.

She had sat thus for some moments, many moments, her gaze intently fixed, as though waiting for something - something or someone that she did not now see, but expected soon to see. <br />It was late afternoon of a day so beautiful that not even old Albemarle, beauty spot of Virginia, ever produced one more beautiful - not in the hundred years preceding that day, nor in the century since then. For this was more than a hundred years ago; and what is now an ancient land was then a half opened region, settled only here and there by the great plantations of the well-to-do. The house that lay at the summit of the long and gentle slope, flanked by its wide galleries - its flung doors opening it from front to rear to the gaze as one approached - had all the rude comfort and assuredness usual with the gentry of that time and place. <br />About the Publisher <br />Forgotten Books publishes hundreds of thousands of rare and classic books.

Despite their separation and the fact that they're both seeing other people, they still share the same interests: fighting for the little guy -- in this case, the beleaguered nurses at a small Catholic hospital that has just been taken over by an enormous health care conglomerate -- and fighting each other. </p><p> While struggling with the strike and her growing feelings for the still exasperating, pigheaded Tony, Nicky also tries to cope with her nagging widowed mother, who desperately wants Nicky married; a slick boss who promises clients more than Nicky can possibly deliver; and an officious assistant who has read too many articles about cutthroat career women. But for Nicky, those troubles pale in comparison to dealing with a bumbling romance between two cousins from opposite sides of her family: Louise, a professional matchmaker with a chaotic love life, and Johnny, whose love for Louise hasn't stopped him from becoming engaged to another woman. </p><p> Can Nicky help a group of hardworking nurses pull off an unlikely victory against a corporate giant? Can she force Johnny to see the error of his ways and declare his love for Louise? And can she ever make the right choice between her current beau and the guy who got away? Warmly amusing and sparkling with insight and keen wit, <i>The Side of the Angels</i> is a refreshing, realistic look at the demands -- and rewards -- of career, commitment, Catholicism, and unforgettable love.<br /></p>",3.14,5:3|4:16|3:25|2:10|1:2|total:56,52,3,304,Scribner,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,0743204611,9780743204613,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/883263.The_Side_of_the_Angels

30315,18926086,Do Fathers Matter?: What Science Is Telling Us About the Parent We've Overlooked,Paul Raeburn,"For too long, we've thought of fathers as little more than sources of authority and economic stability in the lives of their children. Yet cutting-edge studies drawing unexpected links between fathers and children are forcing us to reconsider our assumptions and ask new questions: What changes occur in men when they are ""expecting""? Do fathers affect their children's language development? What are the risks and rewards of being an older-than-average father at the time the child is born? What happens to a father's hormone levels at every stage of his child's development, and can a child influence the father's health? Just how much do fathers <i>matter</i>?<br /> In <i>Do Fathers Matter?</i> the award-winning journalist and father of five Paul Raeburn overturns the many myths and stereotypes of fatherhood as he examines the latest scientific findings on the parent we've often overlooked. Drawing on research from neuroscientists, animal behaviorists, geneticists, and developmental psychologists, among others, Raeburn takes us through the various stages of fatherhood, revealing the profound physiological connections between children and fathers, from conception through adolescence and into adulthood—and the importance of the relationship between mothers and fathers. In the process, he challenges the legacy of Freud and mainstream views of parental attachment, and also explains how we can become better parents ourselves. <br /> Ultimately, Raeburn shows how the role of the father is distinctly different from that of the mother, and that embracing fathers' significance in the lives of young people is something we can all benefit from. An engrossing, eye-opening, and deeply personal book that makes a case for a new perspective on the importance of fathers in our lives no matter what our family structure, <i>Do Fathers Matter?</i> will change the way we view fatherhood today.",3.53,5:55|4:146|3:141|2:44|1:3|total:389,291,54,288,"Scientific American / Farrar, Straus and Giroux",,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1396811847l/18926086._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1396811847l/18926086._SX50_.jpg,0374710821,9780374710828,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18926086-do-fathers-matter

    <p>It is an undeniable truth: give evil a name and everyone’s happy.  Give it two names and…why, they’re even happier.</p>
    <p>Intrepid necromancers Bauchelain and Korbal Broach, scourges of civilization, raisers of the dead, reapers of the souls of the living, devourers of hope, betrayers of faith, slayers of the innocent, and modest personifications of evil, have a lot to answer for and answer they will. Known as the Nehemoth, they are pursued by countless self-professed defenders of decency, sanity, and civilization. After all, since when does evil thrive unchallenged? Well, often—but not this time.</p>
    <p>Hot on their heels are the Nehemothanai, avowed hunters of Bauchelain and Korbal Broach. In the company of a gaggle of artists and pilgrims, stalwart Mortal Sword Tulgord Vise, pious Well Knight Arpo Relent, stern Huntsman Steck Marynd, and three of the redoubtable Chanter brothers (and their lone sister) find themselves faced with the cruelest of choices. The legendary Crack’d Pot Trail, a stretch of harsh wasteland between the Gates of Nowhere and the Shrine of the Indifferent God, has become a tortured path of deprivation.</p>
    <p>Will honor, moral probity, and virtue prove champions in the face of brutal necessity? No, of course not. Don’t be silly.</p>

Greco herself is far from immune to Holt's charm, so when he asks her to accompany him to Chester County Correctional Institution to lecture to inmates involved in an externship program, she quickly agrees. But the professors' visit soon turns deadly; a riot erupts, and amid the chaos Greco finds herself alone with a dying correctional officer who has been stabbed through the heart with a metal shank. His last words are a cryptic message to his wife: ""It's under the floor."" Soon thereafter, Greco is inexplicably set up for the murder of a state trooper and is forced to become a fugitive from justice while she tries to unravel the mystery of the dying man's words. <br /><br />While not as sexually supercharged or frenetically paced as <i>Dirty Blonde</i>, <i>Daddy's Girl</i> derives its power from the subtle and compelling coming-of-age of protagonist Greco, a sheltered and socially naive woman who, when faced with the ultimate adversity, discovers herself.",3.74,5:1900|4:3578|3:2838|2:522|1:112|total:8950,7512,682,336,Harper,eng,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,0060833149,9780060833145,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/84820.Daddy_s_Girl

30338,7905092,Freedom,Jonathan Franzen,"Patty and Walter Berglund were the new pioneers of old St. Paul—the gentrifiers, the hands-on parents, the avant-garde of the Whole Foods generation. Patty was the ideal sort of neighbor, who could tell you where to recycle your batteries and how to get the local cops to actually do their job. She was an enviably perfect mother and the wife of Walter's dreams. Together with Walter—environmental lawyer, commuter cyclist, total family man—she was doing her small part to build a better world.<br /><br />But now, in the new millennium, the Berglunds have become a mystery. Why has their teenage son moved in with the aggressively Republican family next door? Why has Walter taken a job working with Big Coal? What exactly is Richard Katz—outré rocker and Walter's college best friend and rival—still doing in the picture? Most of all, what has happened to Patty? Why has the bright star of Barrier Street become ""a very different kind of neighbor,"" an implacable Fury coming unhinged before the street's attentive eyes?<br /><br />In his first novel since <i>The Corrections</i>, Jonathan Franzen has given us an epic of contemporary love and marriage. Freedom comically and tragically captures the temptations and burdens of liberty: the thrills of teenage lust, the shaken compromises of middle age, the wages of suburban sprawl, the heavy weight of empire. In charting the mistakes and joys of Freedom's characters as they struggle to learn how to live in an ever more confusing world, Franzen has produced an indelible and deeply moving portrait of our time.<br />(jacket)",3.75,5:40080|4:52813|3:32057|2:12529|1:6445|total:143924,129682,12102,562,"Farrar, Straus and Giroux",eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1316729686l/7905092._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1316729686l/7905092._SY75_.jpg,0374158460,9780374158460,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7905092-freedom

It is usually described as one of Tolstoy's two major masterpieces (the other being Anna Karenina) as well as one of the world's greatest novels.<br /><br />War and Peace offered a new kind of fiction, with a great many characters caught up in a plot that covered nothing less than the grand subjects indicated by the title, combined with the equally large topics of youth, marriage, age, and death. Though it is often called a novel today, it broke so many conventions of the form that it was not considered a novel in its time.

30343,35417865,A Discourse Concerning Ridicule and Irony in Writing (1729),Edward a (Edward Alan) Bloom,"INTRODUCTION Between 1710 and 1729 Anthony Collins was lampooned, satirized, and gravely denounced from pulpit and press as England's most insidious defiler of church and state. Yet within a year of his death he became the model of a proper country gentleman, ... he had an opulent Fortune, descended to him from his Ancestors, which he left behind him unimpair'd: He lived on his own Estate in the Country, where his Tenants paid him moderate Rents, which he never enhanced on their making any Improvements; he always oblig'd his Family to a constant attendance on Publick Worship; as he was himself a Man of the strictest Morality, for he never suffer'd any Body about him who was deficient in that Point; he exercised a universal Charity to all Sorts of People, without any Regard either to Sect or Party; being in the Commission of the Peace, he administered Justice with such Impartiality and Incorruptness, that the most distant Part of the County flock'd to his Decisions; but the chief Use he made of his Authority was in accommodating Differences;... In a comparison which likens him to Sir Roger de Coverley, there is less truth than fiction. What they did share was a love of the countryside and a ""universal Charity"" towards its inhabitants. For the most part, however, we can approximate Collins's personality by reversing many of Sir Roger's traits. Often at war with his world, as the spectatorial character was not, he managed to maintain an intellectual rapport with it and even with those who sought his humiliation. He never-as an instance-disguised his philosophical distrust of Samuel Clarke; yet during any debate he planned ""most certainly [to] outdo him in civility and good manners."" This decorum in no way compromised his pursuit of what he considered objective truth or his denunciation of all ""methods"" or impositions of spiritual tyranny. Thus, during the virulent, uneven battle which followed upon the publication of the Discourse of Free-Thinking, he ignored his own wounds in order to applaud a critic's suspicions that there is a sophism in what he calls my hypothesis. That is a temper that ought to go thro' all our Inquirys, and especially before we have an opportunity of examining things to the bottom. It is safest at all times, and we are least likely to be mistaken, if we constantly suspect our selves to be under mistakes.... I have no system to defend or that I would seem to defend, and am unconcerned for the consequence that may be drawn from my opinion; and therefore stand clear of all difficultys wch others either by their opinion or caution are involved in. This is the statement of a man whose intellectual and religious commitment makes him see that his own fallibility is symptomatic of a human tendency to error.

30348,34776067,The Last Suppers,Mandy Mikulencak,"<b>“A gorgeous novel that finds beauty in the most unlikely of places.” —Susan Wiggs, #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author</b><br /><br /><i>Set in 1950s Louisiana, Mandy Mikulencak’s beautifully written and emotionally moving novel evokes both</i> The Help <i>and</i> Dead Man Walking <i>with the story of an unforgettable woman whose quest to provide meals for death row prisoners leads her into the secrets of her own past.</i><br /><br />Many children have grown up in the shadow of Louisiana’s Greenmount State Penitentiary. Most of them—sons and daughters of corrections officers and staff—left the place as soon as they could. Yet Ginny Polk chose to come back to work as a prison cook. She knows the harsh reality of life within those walls—the cries of men being beaten, the lines of shuffling inmates chained together. Yet she has never seen them as monsters, not even the ones sentenced to execution. That’s why, among her duties, Ginny has taken on a special responsibility: preparing their last meals.<br /><br />Pot roast or red beans and rice, coconut cake with seven-minute frosting or pork neck stew . . . whatever the men ask for Ginny prepares, even meeting with their heartbroken relatives to get each recipe just right. It’s her way of honoring their humanity, showing some compassion in their final hours. The prison board frowns upon the ritual, as does Roscoe Simms, Greenmount’s Warden. Her daddy’s best friend before he was murdered, Roscoe has always watched out for Ginny, and their friendship has evolved into something deep and unexpected. But when Ginny stumbles upon information about the man executed for killing her father, it leads to a series of dark and painful revelations.<br /><br />Truth, justice, mercy—none of these are as simple as Ginny once believed. And the most shocking crimes may not be the ones committed out of anger or greed, but the sacrifices we make for love.",3.74,5:303|4:631|3:430|2:96|1:22|total:1482,1138,219,304,Kensington,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1497966157l/34776067._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1497966157l/34776067._SX50_.jpg,1496710037,9781496710031,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34776067-the-last-suppers

30365,168696,In Desert and Wilderness,Henryk Sienkiewicz,"In the tradition of Robinson Crusoe and Treasure Island comes a Sienkiewicz novel for readers of all ages! This thrilling adventure saga and coming-of-age tale sets two young children, Stas Tarkowski, fourteen, and Nelly Rawlison, eight, within the reaches of Africa's desert storms, the ravages of hunger, and threatening jungles filled with vicious animals and warring tribes. Everything for the pair seemed comfortable and safe in Egypt. But when the children are separated from their fathers during a vacation along the Nile, they become pawns in a treacherous plot and are abducted by the vengeful followers of the Mahdi. Joined in their trek by two African children, Kali and Mea, and together with the aid of a faithful dog, Saba, and a mighty elephant, King, the unlikely troop makes its way through deep Africa while facing perilous situations that would render helpless even grown men and women. Throughout this enthralling novel, author Sienkiewicz paints the vivid scenery of what was then known as ""the dark continent,"" a land filled with unknown peoples, primordial landscapes, tall and deep jungles, uncharted rivers and mountains. Political instability, then as now, could make entire regions impassable. In the 1880s one such crisis, a rebellion led by ""the Mahdi,"" threatened to turn a large part of the continent into a hell of destruction and carnage. It is in such a background that Henryk Sienkiewicz, the master storyteller and winner of the 1905 Nobel Prize for literature, placed two European children - the heroes of this engaging tale. For Henryk Sienkiewicz, In Desert and Wilderness represented a final triumph; this was the last novel he would complete. Sienkiewicz, who had visited Africa in 1891, successfully recreates in the book the beauty he encountered amid the continent's entrancing landscape. Written over eighty years ago for a younger audience, but appealing to all ages, In Desert and Wilderness remains a literary treasure in Poland.

Through a blue haze one saw the ground, covered with snow, shining under the magical moon. And the trees of the forest were also covered with snow; great clusters glistened in their branches. Almost as light as day. Not a bleak light, but an enchanting one, which dazzled in the cold, brisk air. Into the woods walked the Spirit of Art. As he gazed at the surrounding beauty he grew sad, and wondered why he had never reproduced such splendor - the moon - the snow - Oh, he must try again - Tomorrow he would do better. <br />Then came the Spirit of History and he too grew sad as he gazed into the quietude of the night. His hands were soiled with blood, with dark hideous crimes. And he asked why he had committed such deeds - with all this beauty around him. Why could he not have likened history to these woods where the snow was white. Tomorrow he would do better. <br />And then came the Spirit of Philosophy and like the others he wondered why he had never been under the spell of the Moonbeams before - why had he filled the minds of men with entangled masses of dark thought, instead of teaching them the beauty, the enchantment of a night like this. Tomorrow he would do better. </i>",2.75,5:1|4:0|3:0|2:3|1:0|total:4,2,1,,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,2940012172488,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10372094-futurist-stories

30387,8349489,Mark Mason's Victory,Horatio Alger Jr.,"Horatio Alger, Jr. (1832-1899) was a 19th-century American author who wrote approximately 135 novels. Many of his works have been described as rags to riches stories, illustrating how down-and-out boys might be able to achieve the American Dream of wealth and success through hard work, courage, determination, and concern for others. He is noted as a significant figure in the history of American cultural and social ideals, even though his novels are rarely read these days. After attending Harvard Divinity School from 1857 to 1860, he took a ten-month tour of Europe and produced works of a patriotic nature. Alger's empathy with the young working men, coupled with the moral values he learned at home, formed the basis of the first novel in his Ragged Dick (1867). The book was an immediate success, spurring a vast collection of sequels and similar novels, including Luck and Pluck (1869) and Tattered Tom (1871). Amongst his other works are Five Hundred Dollars; or, Jacob Marlowe's Secret (1890) and The Young Acrobat of the Great North American Circus (1900).",4.00,5:3|4:5|3:1|2:1|1:0|total:10,3,0,198,Dodo Press,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1409992373,9781409992370,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8349489-mark-mason-s-victory

30390,15778729,The Victorian City: Everyday Life in Dickens' London,Judith Flanders,"From the critically acclaimed author of The Invention of Murder, an extraordinary, revelatory portrait of everyday life on the streets of Dickens' London.<br /><br />The nineteenth century was a time of unprecedented change, and nowhere was this more apparent than London. In only a few decades, the capital grew from a compact Regency town into a sprawling metropolis of 6.5 million inhabitants, the largest city the world had ever seen. Technology—railways, street-lighting, and sewers—transformed both the city and the experience of city-living, as London expanded in every direction. Now Judith Flanders, one of Britain’s foremost social historians, explores the world portrayed so vividly in Dickens’ novels, showing life on the streets of London in colorful, fascinating detail.<br /><br />From the moment Charles Dickens, the century's best-loved English novelist and London's greatest observer, arrived in the city in 1822, he obsessively walked its streets, recording its pleasures, curiosities and cruelties. Now, with him, Judith Flanders leads us through the markets, transport systems, sewers, rivers, slums, alleys, cemeteries, gin palaces, chop-houses and entertainment emporia of Dickens' London, to reveal the Victorian capital in all its variety, vibrancy, and squalor. From the colorful cries of street-sellers to the uncomfortable reality of travel by omnibus, to the many uses for the body parts of dead horses and the unimaginably grueling working days of hawker children, no detail is too small, or too strange. No one who reads Judith Flanders's meticulously researched, captivatingly written The Victorian City will ever view London in the same light again.",3.97,5:335|4:524|3:257|2:40|1:12|total:1168,784,139,525,Atlantic Books,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1343710686l/15778729._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1343710686l/15778729._SY75_.jpg,1848877951,9781848877955,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15778729-the-victorian-city
30391,9335040,Betelguese a Trip Through Hell,Jean Louis De Esque,"Jean Louis De Esque wrote this lyric poem in 1908. The work begins with a short poem entitled When I am Gone. oWHEN I AM GONE What good is Fame when I am dead and gone, When in immarcescible regions My temple rots and soul doth storm and mourn As bones of mine adorn an early grave? Who'll hear and know that I worked hard and long, That twin sighs and tears storm'd me by legions, My life, a sunless one bleak and forlorn. No ray of light whilst I in thralldom slave? What good is Fame when I am dead and gone, When in fenowed abyss', stark and cold, I wend my solemn footsteps and atone, Whilst Fame my brow doth crown with its renown? Who know that heart and soul bled on and on, That storm-swept aches and woes were mine untold, My life a waste, from which there stole a moan, No Aureole whilst I in sorrow drown? What good is Fame when I am dead and gone, When far and wide my praise is heard and sung, WHEN I AM GONE And busts and marble-heads my deeds unfurl To multitudes that knew me not in flesh? Not when I'm gone care I for Renown's dawn, Now, whilst I labour at Fame's lowest rung, Let me reap dame Approval's brightest pearl And sip its olpe as I my battles thresh.o",5.00,5:2|4:0|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:2,2,0,70,Book Jungle,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1438534981,9781438534985,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9335040-betelguese-a-trip-through-hell

This eerie riddle confronts Rick Brant and his friend Don Scott when, seeking shelter from a storm, they anchor the houseboat Spindrift in a lonely cove along the Maryland shore and spot the flying stingaree. The ""thing,"" they learn, is not along, and residents of the Eastern Shore of Maryland believe the strange objects are flying saucers, but, weary of ridicule, have ceased reporting the sightings. Rick and Scotty, their scientific curiosity aroused, begin a comprehensive investigation, encouraged by their friend Steve Ames, a young government intelligence agent, whose summer cottage is near the cove. As the clues mount up, the trail leads to Calvert's Favor, a historic plantation house-and to the very bottom of Chesapeake Bay. How Rick and Scotty, at the risk of their lives, ground the eerie menace forever makes a tale of high-voltage suspense!

30402,23515515,The making of Mona,Adrian Franklin,"In January 2011, MONA was officially opened to the public. It was lauded as the most extraordinary cultural event for Australia since the opening of the Sydney Opera House. David Walsh was a largely mysterious art collector who had made a fortune gambling. He had collected ancient coins and antiquities and established a small museum of antiquities on his Moorilla estate but subsequently he became interested in art of all periods. In 2006, Walsh was the anonymous winning bidder of John Brack's The Bar, which the NGV had so publicly declared it was going to purchase. It was a move that kept the media and art circles guessing for some time and was, in its way, classic Walsh behaviour.<br /><br />Over several years he bought a huge number of works and he started thinking about a gallery space in which to house them. But a conventional museum wasn't what Walsh was after. He wanted to transform the viewer's experience of art. There began the earliest ideas for MONA, a museum of old and new art.<br /><br />Adrian Franklin, professor of sociology at the University of Tasmania, has pieced together the story of the creation of MONA, from how it came to be on the banks of the Derwent River, to the design and building process, the collection and branding and, crucially, designing the experience and effect that MONA has on its many millions of visitors.",3.87,5:8|4:12|3:10|2:1|1:0|total:31,29,7,353,VIKING / Penguin Group (Australia),en-US,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1422098558l/23515515._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1422098558l/23515515._SX50_.jpg,0670077860,9780670077861,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23515515-the-making-of-mona

The bearded man spoke a single, ceremonial phrase and the twelve men rose. They moved toward various doors and one by one left, until the room was empty. But the pilot looked relieved. He grinned cheerfully at Tommy and led the way back to the two-wheeled vehicle. The two men with Tommy's weapons vanished. And again there was a swift, cyclonelike passage along empty ways with the throbbing of machinery audible everywhere. Into the base of a second building, up endless stairs, past innumerable doors. It seemed to Tommy that he heard voices behind some of them, and they were women's voices. At a private, triple knock a door opened wide, and the pilot led the way into a room, closed and locked the door behind him, and called. A woman's voice cried out in astonishment. Through an inner arch a woman came running eagerly. Her face went blank at sight of Tommy and Evelyn, and her hand flew to a tiny golden object at her waist. Then, at the pilot's chuckle, she flushed vividly. Hours later, Tommy and Evelyn were able to talk it over. They were alone then, and could look out an oval window upon the Golden City all about them. It was dark, but saffron-red panels glowed in building walls all along the thoroughfares, and tiny glowing dots in the soaring spires of gold told of people within other dwellings like this. ""As I see it,"" said Tommy restlessly, ""the Council-and it must have been that in the big room to-day-put us in our friend's hands to learn the language. He's been working with me four hours, drawing pictures, and I've been writing down words I've learned. I must have several hundred of them. But we do our best talking with pictures.

30412,19250779,"On the Execution of Music, and Principally of Ancient Music",Camille Saint-Saëns,"MUSIC was written in a scrawl impossible to decipher up to the thirteenth century, when Plain Song (Plain Chant) made its appearance in square and diamond-shaped notes. The graduals and introits had not yet been reduced to bars, but the songs of the troubadours appear to have been in bars of three beats with the accent on the feeble note of each bar. However, the theory that this bar of three beats or triple time was used exclusively is probably erroneous. St. Isidore, in his treatise on music, speaking of how Plain Song should be interpreted, considers in turn all the voices and recommends those which are high, sweet and clear, for the execution of vocal sounds, introits, graduals, offertories, etc. This is exactly contrary to what we now do, since in place of utilizing these light tenor voices for Plain Song, we have recourse to voices both heavy and low.",3.75,5:0|4:3|3:1|2:0|1:0|total:4,3,0,,,eng,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19250779-on-the-execution-of-music-and-principally-of-ancient-music

30416,398445,Waste and Want: A Social History of Trash,Susan Strasser,"An unprecedented look at that most commonplace act of everyday life-throwing things out-and how it has transformed American society.<br /><br />Susan Strasser's pathbreaking histories of housework and the rise of the mass market have become classics in the literature of consumer culture. Here she turns to an essential but neglected part of that culture-the trash it produces-and finds in it an unexpected wealth of meaning.<br /><br />Before the twentieth century, streets and bodies stank, but trash was nearly nonexistent. With goods and money scarce, almost everything was reused. Strasser paints a vivid picture of an America where scavenger pigs roamed the streets, swill children collected kitchen garbage, and itinerant peddlers traded manufactured goods for rags and bones. Over the last hundred years, however, Americans have become hooked on convenience, disposability, fashion, and constant technological change-the rise of mass consumption has led to waste on a previously unimaginable scale.<br /><br />Lively and colorful, Waste and Want recaptures a hidden part of our social history, vividly illustrating that what counts as trash depends on who's counting, and that what we throw away defines us as much as what we keep.",3.80,5:81|4:125|3:82|2:24|1:5|total:317,284,36,368,Holt Paperbacks,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1316136424l/398445._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1316136424l/398445._SY75_.jpg,0805065121,9780805065121,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/398445.Waste_and_Want

30419,35764044,"How to Form a Library, 2nd Ed",Henry B. Wheatley,"PREFACE. It will be generally allowed that a handy guide to the formation of libraries is required, but it may be that the difficulty of doing justice to so large a subject has prevented those who felt the want from attempting to fill it. I hope therefore that it will not be considered that I have shown temerity by stepping into the vacant place. I cannot hope to have done full justice to so important a theme in the small space at my disposal, but I think I can say that this little volume contains much information which the librarian and the book lover require and cannot easily obtain elsewhere. They are probably acquainted with most of this information, but the memory will fail us at times and it is then convenient to have a record at hand. A book of this character is peculiarly open to criticism, but I hope the critics will give me credit for knowing more than I have set down. In making a list of books of reference, I have had to make a selection, and works have been before me that I have decided to omit, although some would think them as important as many of those I have included. I need not extend this preface with any lengthy explanation of the objects of the book, as these are stated in the Introduction, but before concluding I may perhaps be allowed to allude to one personal circumstance. I had hoped to dedicate this first volume of the Book Lover's Library to Henry Bradshaw, one of the most original and most learned bibliographers that ever lived, but before it was finished the spirit of that great man had passed away to the inexpressible grief of all who knew him. It is with no desire to shield myself under the shelter of a great name, but with a reverent wish to express my own sense of our irreparable loss that I dedicate this book (though all unworthy of the honour) to his memory. CONTENTS. PAGE Introduction Chapter I. How Men have Formed Libraries II. How to Buy III. Public Libraries IV. Private Libraries V. General Bibliographies VI. Special Bibliographies VII. Publishing Societies VIII. Child's Library IX. One Hundred Books HOW TO FORM A LIBRARY. Introduction. Although there can be little difference of opinion among book lovers as to the need of a Handbook which shall answer satisfactorily the question-""How to Form a Library""-it does not follow that there will be a like agreement as to the best shape in which to put the answer. On the one side a string of generalities can be of no use to any one, and on the other a too great particularity of instruction may be resented by those who only require hints on a few points, and feel that they know their own business better than any author can tell them. One of the most important attempts to direct the would-be founder of a Library in his way was made as long ago as 1824 by Dr. Dibdin, and the result was entitled The Library Companion. The book could never have been a safe guide, and now it is hopelessly out of date. Tastes change, and many books upon the necessity of possessing which Dibdin enlarges are now little valued....",4.67,5:2|4:1|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:3,0,0,,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1547161485,9781547161485,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35764044-how-to-form-a-library-2nd-ed

30429,15793193,And Man Created God: A History of the World at the Time of Jesus,Selina O'Grady,"A groundbreaking history of the age when empires used religions to become powerful and religions used empires to spread their message <br /><br />At the end of the first century BC, the world was full of gods. Thousands of them jostled, competed and merged with one another. In Syria ecstatic devotees castrated themselves in the streets so as to become priests of Atargatis. In Galilee, holy men turned oil into wine and claimed to be the Messiah. Kings, queens, and emperors were riding on the backs of these religions to increase their power.<br /><br /><i>And Man Created God</i> considers how and why religious belief has had such an immense impact on human history by identifying the roots of belief within societies. O'Grady looks at the whole world during one short period and asks a specific question: Why did Christianity grow so quickly and become the predominant world religion? The beliefs held by a tiny Jewish sect in an obscure corner of the then mighty Roman Empire would have seemed doomed to disappear within a few generations. Instead, they became the official religion of the Empire. What was it about Christian ideas that appealed to people in so many different cultures at that time? Beginning in Rome, expanding her review out to Gaul, Germania, North Africa, the Near East, Persia, and beyond to China, the author sifts through the economic, political and sociocultural facts to understand why some ideas die and others thrive in a thrilling new work of history.",3.74,5:47|4:128|3:73|2:15|1:5|total:268,175,28,416,St. Martin's Press,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1344318823l/15793193._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1344318823l/15793193._SY75_.jpg,1250016819,9781250016812,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15793193-and-man-created-god

30448,26114417,The Good Lieutenant,Whitney Terrell,"<b>An acclaimed American novelist with a keen eye for our biggest issues and themes turns his gaze to Iraq, with astonishing results</b><br /><i></i><br /><i>The Good Lieutenant</i> literally starts with a bang as an operation led by Lieutenant Emma Fowler of the Twenty-seventh Infantry Battalion goes spectacularly wrong. Men are dead--one, a young Iraqi, by her hand. Others were soldiers in her platoon. And the signals officer, Dixon Pulowski. Pulowski is another story entirely--Fowler and Pulowski had been lovers since they met at Fort Riley in Kansas.<br /><br />From this conflagration, <i>The Good Lieutenant</i> unspools backward in time as Fowler and her platoon are guided into disaster by suspicious informants and questionable intelligence, their very mission the result of a previous snafu in which a soldier had been kidnapped by insurgents. And then even further back, before things began to go so wrong, we see the backstory unfold from points of view that usually are not shown in war coverage--a female frontline officer, for one, but also jaded career soldiers and Iraqis both innocent and not so innocent. Ultimately, as all these stories unravel, what is revealed is what happens when good intentions destroy, experience distorts, and survival becomes everything.<br /><br />Brilliantly told and expertly captured by a terrific writer at the top of his form, Whitney Terrell's <i>The Good Lieutenant</i> is a gripping, insightful, necessary novel about a war that is proving to be the defining tragedy of our time.",3.19,5:31|4:43|3:53|2:39|1:16|total:182,168,40,275,"Farrar, Straus and Giroux",eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1448215135l/26114417._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1448215135l/26114417._SY75_.jpg,0374164738,9780374164737,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26114417-the-good-lieutenant

30486,31168,Shirley,Charlotte Brontë,"Following the tremendous popular success of <i>Jane Eyre,</i> which earned her lifelong notoriety as a moral revolutionary, Charlotte Brontë vowed to write a sweeping social chronicle that focused on ""something real and unromantic as Monday morning."" Set in the industrializing England of the Napoleonic wars and Luddite revolts of 1811-12, <i>Shirley</i> (1849) is the story of two contrasting heroines. One is the shy Caroline Helstone, who is trapped in the oppressive atmosphere of a Yorkshire rectory and whose bare life symbolizes the plight of single women in the nineteenth century. The other is the vivacious Shirley Keeldar, who inherits a local estate and whose wealth liberates her from convention.<br /><br />A work that combines social commentary with the more private preoccupations of <i>Jane Eyre, Shirley</i> demonstrates the full range of Brontë's literary talent. <i>""Shirley</i> is a revolutionary novel,"" wrote Brontë biographer Lyndall Gordon. <i>""Shirley</i> follows <i>Jane Eyre</i> as a new exemplar but so much a forerunner of the feminist of the later twentieth century that it is hard to believe in her actual existence in 1811-12.

In the cabin, it was accepted that he would cross their path again, though it was hoped that Fire Mountain would be reached and the treasure secured before that event occurred. But, save for an ever-growing indignation against the haughty Englishman, for daring to aspire to Ruth LeMoyne's hand, Martin gave the matter small thought; he was too busy living the moment. Concurrent with his education in seamanship, progressed Martin's instruction in the subtle and disquieting game of hearts. Ruth attended to this particular instruction unconsciously, perhaps, but none the less effectively. Of course, it was inevitable. When a romantic-minded young man aids in the thrilling rescue of an imprisoned maid, that young man is going to look upon that young woman with more than passing interest. When the maid in question happens to be extremely pretty, his interest is naturally enhanced. When he is thrown into a close shipboard intimacy with her, and discovers her to be at once an exacting tyrant and a jolly chum, when the maid is possessed of a strange and exciting history, and congenial tastes, when she is not unaware of her own excellence, and, at times, not disinclined to coquet a trifle before a young, virile male",3.80,5:7|4:6|3:5|2:0|1:2|total:20,18,1,,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19003227-fire-mountain-a-thrilling-sea-story

A journey by water; a voyage.<br />iii. The transition from one place to another, across space and time.<br /><br />In one devastating night, violin prodigy Etta Spencer loses everything she knows and loves. Thrust into an unfamiliar world by a stranger with a dangerous agenda, Etta is certain of only one thing: she has traveled not just miles but years from home. And she’s inherited a legacy she knows nothing about from a family whose existence she’s never heard of. Until now.<br /><br />Nicholas Carter is content with his life at sea, free from the Ironwoods—a powerful family in the colonies—and the servitude he’s known at their hands. But with the arrival of an unusual passenger on his ship comes the insistent pull of the past that he can’t escape and the family that won’t let him go so easily. Now the Ironwoods are searching for a stolen object of untold value, one they believe only Etta, Nicholas’ passenger, can find. In order to protect her, he must ensure she brings it back to them—whether she wants to or not.<br /><br />Together, Etta and Nicholas embark on a perilous journey across centuries and continents, piecing together clues left behind by the traveler who will do anything to keep the object out of the Ironwoods’ grasp. But as they get closer to the truth of their search, and the deadly game the Ironwoods are playing, treacherous forces threaten to separate Etta not only from Nicholas but from her path home... forever.<br /><br /><i>Alternate cover for this ISBN can be found <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28525008-passenger"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a></i>",3.79,5:9125|4:12882|3:7722|2:2610|1:1078|total:33417,30199,5332,496,Disney-Hyperion,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1446749751l/20983362._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1446749751l/20983362._SY75_.jpg,1484715772,9781484715772,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20983362-passenger

Not in the distant future—now. One recent estimate predicts 45 million American workers will lose their jobs within the next twelve years—jobs that won't be replaced. In a future marked by restlessness and chronic unemployment, what will happen to American society? <br /><br /> In <i>The War on Normal People</i>, Andrew Yang paints a dire portrait of the American economy. Rapidly advancing technologies like artificial intelligence, robotics and automation software are making millions of Americans' livelihoods irrelevant. The consequences of these trends are already being felt across our communities in the form of political unrest, drug use, and other social ills. The future looks dire-but is it unavoidable?<br /><br /> In <i>The War on Normal People</i>, Yang imagines a different future—one in which having a job is distinct from the capacity to prosper and seek fulfillment. At this vision's core is Universal Basic Income, the concept of providing all citizens with a guaranteed income-and one that is rapidly gaining popularity among forward-thinking politicians and economists. Yang proposes that UBI is an essential step toward a new, more durable kind of economy, one he calls ""human capitalism.""",4.31,5:1320|4:1018|3:339|2:58|1:8|total:2743,2277,464,304,Hachette Books,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1520448030l/36204293._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1520448030l/36204293._SY75_.jpg,0316414247,9780316414241,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36204293-the-war-on-normal-people

After months of fruitless searching, they finally grapple with their quarry, but Aronnax, Conseil, and the brash Canadian harpooner Ned Land are thrown overboard in the attack, only to find that the “monster” is actually a futuristic submarine, the Nautilus, commanded by a shadowy, mystical, preternaturally imposing man who calls himself Captain Nemo. Thus begins a journey of 20,000 leagues—nearly 50,000 miles—that will take Captain Nemo, his crew, and these three adventurers on a journey of discovery through undersea forests, coral graveyards, miles-deep trenches, and even the sunken ruins of Atlantis.

Between the river and the mountains lay the reservation from which the government had pushed the Indians, and which it had cut into parcels to be drawn by lot. <br />And so Comanche was there on the white plain to serve the present, and temporary, purpose of housing and feeding the thousands who had collected there at the lure of chance with practical, impractical, speculative, romantic, honest, and dishonest ideas and intentions. </i>",0.00,5:0|4:0|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:0,0,0,362,Forgotten Books,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1442829600l/26292276._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1442829600l/26292276._SX50_.jpg,1331380464,9781331380467,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26292276-claim-number-one

Jesus answered and said unto him, ""If a man love me, he will keep my word: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him. He that loveth me not keepeth not my words: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father's who sent me. ""These things have I spoken unto you, while yet abiding with you. But the Comforter, even the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all that I said unto you. Peace I leave with you; my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be fearful. Ye heard how I said to you, I go away, and I come unto you. If ye loved me, ye would have rejoiced, because I go unto the Father: for the Father is greater than I. ""And now I have told you before it come to pass, Pg 34 that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe. I will no more speak much with you, for the prince of the world cometh: and he hath nothing in me; but that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do."" ""I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman. Every branch in me that beareth not fruit, he taketh it away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he cleanseth it, that it may bear more fruit. Already ye are clean because of the word which I have spoken unto you. Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; so neither can ye, except ye abide in me. I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same beareth much fruit: for apart from me ye can do nothing. If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and they gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.

A huge swell pushed up exactly under her middle, and her bow and stern hung free with nothing to support them. Then one joking wave caught her up at the bow, and another at the stern, while the rest of the water slunk 251 away from under her just to see how she would like it; so she was held up at her two ends only, and the weight of the cargo and the machinery fell on the groaning iron keels and bilge-stringers. ""Ease off! Ease off, there!"" roared the garboard-strake. ""I want one-eighth of an inch fair play. D' you hear me, you rivets!"" ""Ease off! Ease off!"" cried the bilge-stringers. ""Don't hold us so tight to the frames!"" ""Ease off!"" grunted the deck-beams, as the Dimbula rolled fearfully. ""You've cramped our knees into the stringers, and we can't move. Ease off, you flat-headed little nuisances."" Then two converging seas hit the bows, one on each side, and fell away in torrents of streaming thunder. ""Ease off!"" shouted the forward collision-bulkhead. ""I want to crumple up, but I'm stiffened in every direction. Ease off, you dirty little forge-filings. Let me breathe!"" All the hundreds of plates that are riveted to the frames, and make the outside skin of every steamer, echoed the call, for each plate wanted to shift and creep a little, and each plate, according to its position, complained against the rivets. ""We can't help it! We can't help it!"" they murmured in reply. ""We're put here to hold you, and we're going to do it; you never pull us twice in the same direction. If you'd say what 252 you were going to do next, we'd try to meet your views."" ""As far as I could feel,"" said the upper-deck planking, and that was four inches thick, ""every single iron near me was pushing or pulling in opposite directions. Now, what's the sense of that?

30574,176843,"The Outstretched Shadow (Obsidian Mountain, #1)",Mercedes Lackey,"Kellen Tavadon, son of the Arch-Mage Lycaelon, thought he knew the way the world worked. His father, leading the wise and benevolent Council of Mages, protected and guided the citizens of the Golden City of the Bells. Young Mages in training-all men, for women were unfit to practice magic-memorized the intricate details of High Magic and aspired to seats on the council. <br />Then he found the forbidden Books of Wild Magic-or did they find him? The three slim volumes woke Kellen to the wide world outside the City's isolating walls. Their Magic was not dead, strangled by rules and regulations. It felt like a living thing, guided by the hearts and minds of those who practiced it and benefited from it. <br />Questioning everything he has known, Kellen discovers too many of the City's dark secrets. Banished, with the Outlaw Hunt on his heels, Kellen invokes Wild Magic-and finds himself running for his life with a unicorn at his side. <br />Kellen's life changes almost faster than he can understand or accept. Rescued by a unicorn, healed by a female Wild Mage who knows more about Kellen than anyone outside the City should, meeting Elven royalty and Elven warriors, and plunged into a world where the magical beings he has learned about as abstract concepts are flesh and blood creatures-Kellen both revels in and fears his new freedom. <br />Especially once he learns about Demons. He'd always thought they were another abstract concept-a stand-in for ultimate evil. But if centaurs and dryads are real, then Demons surely are as well. And the one thing all the Mages of the City agreed on was that practicing Wild Magic corrupted a Mage. Turned him into a Demon. Would that be Kellen's fate? <br />Deep in Obsidian Mountain, the Demons are waiting. Since their defeat in the last great War, they've been biding their time, sowing the seeds of distrust and discontent between their human and Elven enemies. Very soon now, when the Demons rise to make war, there will be no alliance between High and Wild Magic to stand against them. And all the world will belong to the Endarkened. <br />",4.01,5:3824|4:3624|3:2102|2:534|1:189|total:10273,9220,285,604,Tor Books,en-US,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,0765302195,9780765302199,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/176843.The_Outstretched_Shadow

30577,7895369,Told in the Coffee House: Turkish Tales,Cyrus Adler,"In the course of a number of visits to Constantinople, I became much interested in the tales that are told in the coffee houses. These are usually little more than rooms, with walls made of small panes of glass. The furniture consists of a tripod with a contrivance for holding the kettle, and a fire to keep the coffee boiling. A carpeted bench traverses the entire length of the room. This is occupied by turbaned Turks, their legs folded under them, smoking nargilehs or chibooks or cigarettes, and sipping coffee. A few will be engaged in a game of backgammon, but the majority enter into conversation, at first only in syllables, which gradually gives rise to a general discussion. Finally, some sage of the neighborhood comes in, and the company appeals to him to settle the point at issue. This he usually does by telling a story to illustrate his opinion. Some of the stories told on these occasions are adaptations of those already known in Arabic and Persian literature, but the Turkish mind gives them a new setting and a peculiar philosophy. They are characteristic of the habits, customs, and methods of thought of the people, and for this reason seem worthy of preservation.",3.36,5:2|4:9|3:21|2:1|1:0|total:33,28,7,174,The Macmillan Company,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1273007109l/7895369._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1273007109l/7895369._SY75_.jpg,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7895369-told-in-the-coffee-house

30597,41548445,"The Battle of Atlanta and Other Campaigns, Addresses, Etc.: Large Print",Grenville Mellen Dodge,"The Battle of Atlanta and Other Campaigns, Addresses, Etc. by Grenville Mellen Dodge The Southwest became prominent before the nation early in the war from the doubt existing as to the position of Missouri, which was saved by the energy and determination of Frank P. Blair and Colonel Nathaniel Lyon; the latter first capturing Camp Jackson, on May 10th, 1861. He then, picking up what force he could without waiting for them to be disciplined or drilled, marched rapidly against the Missouri State troops under Price, who were driven to the southwest through Springfield, where, being joined by the troops from Arkansas, under Colonel McCullough, they stood and fought the battle of Wilson's Creek. This would have been a great victory for the Union forces if Lyon had not divided his forces at the request of General Siegel and trusted the latter to carry out his plan of attack in the rear while Lyon attacked in the front. This General Siegel failed to do, leaving the field when the battle was half over, and allowing Lyon to fight it out alone. Even then, if Lyon had not been killed at the head of his Army while fighting the whole force of the enemy, it would have turned out to be a great victory for the Union forces, and would have held that country. The death of Lyon caused a return of his troops to Rolla and Sedalia, and opened up again the whole of Missouri to the Missouri State troops under General Price. One of the notable facts of this battle of Wilson's Creek was that it was fought by young officers who ranked only as Captains and Lieutenants, all of whom afterwards became distinguished officers in the war-Schofield, Sturgis, Totten, DuBois, and Sweeny-and from the fact that in the first great battle of the Southwest one of the two commanders of Armies falling at the head of their forces in battle was killed here-General Lyon. The other was General McPherson, who fell at Atlanta. Lyon pursued the tactics of Grant by attacking the enemy wherever to be found, and not taking into consideration the disparity of forces. The excitement caused by Lyon's campaigns induced the Government to create the Western Department, and assign to it on July 25th, 1861, General John C. Fremont as its commander.

30603,3473541,Histoire Du Consulat Et De L'empire,Jacques-Olivier Boudon,"L'histoire d'un pouvoir autoritaire qui voit une personnalité exceptionnelle consolider les acquis de la Révolution et fonder des institutions dont la longévité surprend.<br /><br />Les années 1799-1815, de Brumaire à Waterloo, ont profondément bouleversé le visage de l'Europe. Au milieu du fracas des armes, des victoires puis des défaites militaires, sous la férule d'un Napoléon Bonaparte au pouvoir sans cesse renforcé, une œuvre considérable se construit. La France consolide les acquis de la Révolution et inaugure des institutions dont la longévité surprend encore, dans l'administration, la justice, les finances ou l'école. A côté de la personnalité hors du commun de l'Empereur, une génération d'hommes des Lumières contribue à bâtir l'édifice. C'est à la construction de cette œuvre, fondatrice de la France et de l'Europe modernes, que ce livre s'attache. Mais il donne aussi à comprendre l'originalité d'un régime autoritaire qui n'est pas chez nous sans postérité. Napoléon a réussi en effet à rétablir la monarchie en France sans remettre en cause les principes de 1789, et en s'appuyant sur des soutiens très divers, de l'Eglise à la franc-maçonnerie. La société, dans laquelle l'armée joue un rôle grandissant, se transforme elle aussi durant ces quinze années. Epopée pour les uns, dictature pour les autres, l'époque napoléonienne continue de fasciner les esprits parce qu'elle représente, à tous points de vue, une période exceptionnelle.<br /><br />Ancien élève de l'Ecole normale supérieure, agrégé et docteur habilité en histoire, Jacques-Olivier Boudon, né en 1962, est professeur d'histoire contemporaine à l'université de Rouen et président de l'Institut Napoléon.",4.00,5:0|4:2|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:2,2,0,512,Perrin,fre,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1566319185l/3473541._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1566319185l/3473541._SY75_.jpg,2262020051,9782262020057,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3473541-histoire-du-consulat-et-de-l-empire

Abbott. Reprinted by Canon Press, these biographies have been edited and brought up-to-date for readers twelve and up. Not only are these editions given vintage style paperback covers, but they also include introductions that explain where these men and women fit into the timeline of history. ""Abbott's account of Alexander's life reads like a Greek tragedy. We are reminded of Jesus' admonition, ""For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?"" (Mt. 16:26a). Alexander gained the world, but at what cost? Abbott's book is an easy but fascinating read, providing insights and details into the life of one of history's most prominent, yet puzzling, figures.

Run by celebrity power couple Drs. Miles and Grace Markell, the ""last resort"" offers a chance for partners to repair their relationships in a luxurious setting on the gorgeous Mayan Riviera.<br /><br />Johanna and Ben have a marriage that looks perfect on the surface, but in reality, they don’t know each other at all. Shell and Colin fight constantly: after all, Colin is a workaholic, and Shell always comes second to his job as an executive at a powerful mining company. But what has really torn them apart is too devastating to talk about. When both couples begin Harmony's intensive therapy program, it becomes clear that Harmony is not all it seems—and neither are Miles and Grace themselves. What are they hiding, and what price will these couples pay for finding out?<br /><br />As a deadly tropical storm descends on the coast, trapping the hosts and the guests on the resort, secrets are revealed, loyalties are tested and not one single person—or their marriage—will remain unchanged by what follows.<br /> <br />Marissa Stapley is a journalist and the author of the acclaimed novel <i>Things to Do When It's Raining</i>.

30655,6295184,Der Kübelreiter · Ein Hungerkünstler,Franz Kafka,"Die Parabel „Der Kübelreiter“ spielt in einem eiskalten Winter. Ein Mann besitzt keine Kohle mehr im Haus, und da er bereits dem Erfrieren nahe ist, beschließt er auf seinem leeren Kohlekübel zu seinem Kohlehändler zu reiten. Beim Kohlehändler angekommen, hört dieser zwar seine Stimme, doch seine Frau gibt vor, niemanden zu hören. Schließlich muss der „Kübelreiter“ wieder ohne Kohle fortreiten, doch diesmal auf Nimmerwiedersehen ins Eisgebirge. Mit der Kälte des Winters, die in dieser Parabel spürbar wird, benutzt Kafka eine starke Metapher für die soziale Kälte und Ignoranz seiner Mitmenschen, die ebenfalls tödliche Folgen haben kann. Auch die Parabel „Ein Hungerkünstler“ ist realistisch und fantastisch zugleich. Ein Hungerkünstler hungert aus Ekel vor jeglicher gewöhnlicher Nahrung und ist dabei ständig auf der Suche nach einer unbekannten Speise. Dadurch wird er zu einer Sensation, sodass ihn schließlich sogar ein Zirkus engagiert. Dort lebt er eingesperrt in einen Käfig und wird bald von der Menge und dem Aufsichtspersonal vergessen. Als er verhungert, nimmt ein Panther seinen Platz im Käfig ein. Besonders der Schluss verdeutlicht Kafkas Kritik an der Ideologie des Kampfs ums Dasein, doch auch Kafkas Selbstverständnis als Künstler bringt er hier zum Ausdruck. Neben „Der Kübelreiter“ und „Ein Hungerkünstler“ sind in diesem Leseheft auch Kafkas „Betrachtungen“ und die Erzählung „Ein Landarzt“ enthalten.",3.18,5:3|4:5|3:7|2:7|1:0|total:22,22,1,96,Hamburger Lesehefte,ger,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1353494716l/6295184._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1353494716l/6295184._SY75_.jpg,3872911880,9783872911889,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6295184-der-k-belreiter-ein-hungerk-nstler
30656,641604,Purple Cow: Transform Your Business by Being Remarkable,Seth Godin,"The acclaimed Wall Street Journal and Business Week Bestseller.<br /><br />You're either a Purple Cow or you're not. You're either remarkable or invisible. Make your choice. <br /><br />What do Starbucks and JetBlue and KrispyKreme and Apple and DutchBoy and Kensington and Zespri and Hard Candy have that you don't? How do they continue to confound critics and achieve spectacular growth, leaving behind former tried-and true brands to gasp their last? <br /><br />Face it, the checklist of tired 'P's marketers have used for decades to get their product noticed - Pricing, Promotion, Publicity, to name a few - aren't working anymore. There's an exceptionally important 'P' that has to be added to the list. It's Purple Cow. <br /><br />Cows, after you've seen one, or two, or ten, are boring. A Purple Cow, though...now that would be something. Purple Cow describes something phenomenal, something counterintuitive and exciting and flat out unbelievable. Every day, consumers come face to face with a lot of boring stuff-a lot of brown cows - but you can bet they won't forget a Purple Cow. And it's not a marketing function that you can slap on to your product or service. Purple Cow is inherent. It's built right in, or it's not there. Period. <br /><br />In Purple Cow, Seth Godin urges you to put a Purple Cow into everything you build, and everything you do, to create something truly noticeable. It's a manifesto for marketers who want to help create products that are worth marketing in the first place. <br /><br />Description from Amazon.com",3.75,5:12860|4:12833|3:9215|2:3217|1:2430|total:40555,38448,1032,160,Portfolio Hardcover,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1309203098l/641604._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1309203098l/641604._SX50_.jpg,159184021X,9781591840213,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/641604.Purple_Cow

30659,40764036,The Works of Robert Louis Stevenson - Swanston Edition Vol. 14,Andrew Lang,"The Works of Robert Louis Stevenson - Swanston Edition Vol. 14 by Andrew Lang BED IN SUMMER In winter I get up at night And dress by yellow candle-light. In summer, quite the other way, - I have to go to bed by day. I have to go to bed and see The birds still hopping on the tree, Or hear the grown-up people's feet Still going past me in the street. And does it not seem hard to you, When all the sky is clear and blue, And I should like so much to play, To have to go to bed by day? II A THOUGHT It is very nice to think The world is full of meat and drink, With little children saying grace In every Christian kind of place III AT THE SEA-SIDE When I was down beside the sea, A wooden spade they gave to me To dig the sandy shore. My holes were empty like a cup, In every hole the sea came up, Till it could come no more. IV YOUNG NIGHT THOUGHT All night long, and every night, When my mamma puts out the light, I see the people marching by, As plain as day, before my eye. Armies and emperors and kings, All carrying different kinds of things, And marching in so grand a way, You never saw the like by day.

30689,7979926,The Brass Bottle,F. Anstey,"Thomas Anstey Guthrie (1856-1934), was an English novelist and journalist, who wrote his comic novels under the pseudonym F. Anstey. He was educated at King's College London and at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, and was called to the bar in 1880. But the popular success of his story Vice Versa (1882) with its topsy-turvy substitution of a father for his schoolboy son, at once made his reputation as a humourist of an original type. He published in 1883 a serious novel, The Giant's Robe; but, in spite of its excellence, he discovered that it was not as a serious novelist but as a humourist that the public insisted on regarding him. As such his reputation was further confirmed by The Black Poodle (1884), The Tinted Venus (1885), and A Fallen Idol (1886). Many of Anstey's stories have been adapted into theatrical productions and motion pictures. The Tinted Venus (1885) was adapted by S. J. Perelman, Ogden Nash, and Kurt Weill into One Touch of Venus in 1943.",3.51,5:8|4:30|3:34|2:6|1:0|total:78,54,14,226,Dodo Press,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1409939715,9781409939719,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7979926-the-brass-bottle

She's been admitted to Wellesley, but her dad just lost his job, and somehow she has to come up with a year of tuition herself. But Shannon's dream of making big bucks waitressing at the local casino, the Collosio, disappears faster than a gambler's lucky streak. Her boss is a tyrant, her coworker is nuts, and her chances of balancing a tray full of drinks while wearing high-heeled shoes are slim to none. Worse, time is running out, and Shannon hasn't made even half the money she'd hoped.<br /> <br />When Shannon receives a mysterious invitation to join Aces Up, a secret network of highly talented college poker players, at first she thinks <u>No way</u>. She has enough to worry about: keeping her job, winning the coveted math scholarship at school, and tutoring her secret crush, Max. But when Shannon musters up the nerve to kiss Max and he doesn't react at all, the allure of Aces Up and its sexy eighteen-year-old leader, Cole, is suddenly too powerful to ignore.<br /><br />Soon Shannon's caught up in a web of lies and deceit that makes worrying about tuition money or a high school crush seem like kid stuff. Still, when the money's this good, is the fear of getting caught reason enough to fold?<br /><br />This fun, sexy, recession-proof story is a bubbly summer read with surprising depth”great for fans of Sarah Mlynowski.<br />",3.40,5:1037|4:1200|3:1708|2:760|1:254|total:4959,4908,287,272,Ember,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320449810l/7204637._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320449810l/7204637._SY75_.jpg,0385738749,9780385738743,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7204637-aces-up

30703,1246328,Aziyadé : suivi de Fantôme d'Orient,Pierre Loti,"Pierre Loti, dont on imagine mal quelle gloire retentissante il connut de son vivant, est aujourd'hui presque tombé dans l'oubli. Son premier roman, Aziyadé, évoque pour nous les charmes surannés de l'exotisme. Les oeuvres de Loti ont vieilli, leur mélancolie quelque peu apprêtée a mal supporté l'épreuve du temps. Classique, fluide, impeccablement équilibrée, l'écriture demeure pourtant un modèle d'élégance, avec sa grâce un peu glacée. Quant à cette histoire d'amour entre un jeune officier de marine et sa belle esclave circassienne, mélange subtil de tendresse et de cruauté, elle s'exprime à travers des couleurs chatoyantes, des parfums et une sensualité qui n'ont plus rien à voir avec un quelconque Orient de pacotille. Loti ne s'encombre ni de clichés ni de bons sentiments. Et c'est un écrivain sensible, tourmenté, qui transparaît dans ces pages teintées d'amertume.",3.48,5:19|4:49|3:52|2:18|1:1|total:139,139,8,406,Gallimard,fre,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1361749860l/1246328._SY160_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1361749860l/1246328._SY75_.jpg,2070381471,9782070381470,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1246328.Aziyad_

That won’t stop Chester Carson and his comrades. Seeking a way across the Channel, they make for the coast, unaware that Britain has been abandoned, Belfast is a ruin, and that radiation is seeping into the Irish Sea. If they knew, that wouldn’t stop them either. They’re on a quest to save their family, their friends, and humanity itself; failure is not an option. <br />As they journey through war-ravaged ports and storm-wrecked beaches, a new truth becomes clear. The flotilla that found refuge on Anglesey wasn’t the only group of sea-borne refugees to have survived the outbreak. There are other survivors. Some good, some evil, some just determined to do their duty no matter the cost. <br /> <br />Danger lurks along the French and Belgian coasts. So do answers, and hope that humanity now has a future.",4.55,5:175|4:69|3:20|2:4|1:0|total:268,264,27,,,eng,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43264270-where-there-s-hope

But soon Bazarov’s outspoken rejection of authority and social conventions touches off quarrels, misunderstandings, and romantic entanglements that will utterly transform the Kirsanov household and reflect the changes taking place across all of nineteenth-century Russia. <br /><br />Fathers and Sons enraged the old and the young, reactionaries, romantics, and radicals alike when it was first published.

Fathers and Sons is now considered one of the greatest novels of the nineteenth century.<br /><br />A timeless depiction of generational conflict during social upheaval, it vividly portrays the clash between the older Russian aristocracy and the youthful radicalism that foreshadowed the revolution to come—and offers modern-day readers much to reflect upon as they look around at their own tumultuous, ever changing world. <br /><br />Introduction by Jane Costlow",3.96,5:19198|4:23564|3:13862|2:2933|1:632|total:60189,48721,1078,244,Signet Book,eng,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,0451529693,9780451529695,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19117.Fathers_and_Sons

Perché se è vero «che ci sono paesi che ci incantano e altri che ci maltrattano o che sono una pena per gli occhi e ci danno l’emicrania», è anche vero che molto dipende dalla nostra disposizione ad accogliere quello che ci viene<br />presentato: «L’anima non si dà, non si concede, non svela niente della sua intimità.

30728,2767052,"The Hunger Games (The Hunger Games, #1)",Suzanne Collins,"Could you survive on your own, in the wild, with everyone out to make sure you don't live to see the morning?<br /><br />In the ruins of a place once known as North America lies the nation of Panem, a shining Capitol surrounded by twelve outlying districts. The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV. Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who lives alone with her mother and younger sister, regards it as a death sentence when she is forced to represent her district in the Games. But Katniss has been close to dead before - and survival, for her, is second nature. Without really meaning to, she becomes a contender. But if she is to win, she will have to start making choices that weigh survival against humanity and life against love.<br /><br />New York Times bestselling author Suzanne Collins delivers equal parts suspense and philosophy, adventure and romance, in this searing novel set in a future with unsettling parallels to our present.",4.33,5:3162096|4:1763694|3:680868|2:156402|1:82625|total:5845685,5636754,148994,374,Scholastic Press,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1447303603l/2767052._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1447303603l/2767052._SX50_.jpg,0439023483,9780439023481,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2767052-the-hunger-games

30732,27242577,A Woman on the Edge of Time: A Son’s Search for His Mother,Jeremy Gavron,"<b>It's 1965, and in Primrose Hill, north London, a beautiful young woman has just gassed herself to death, leaving behind a suicide note, two small children, and an about-to-be-published manuscript: <i>The Captive Wife</i>.<br /></b><br /><br /><br />Like Sylvia Plath, who died in eerily similar circumstances two years earlier just two streets away, Hannah Gavron was a writer. But no-one had ever imagined that she might take her own life. Bright, sophisticated, and swept up in the progressive politics of the 1960s, Hannah was a promising academic and the wife of a rising entrepreneur. Surrounded by success, she seemed to live a gilded life.<br /><br /><br /><br />But there was another side to Hannah, as Jeremy Gavron's searching memoir of his mother reveals. Piecing together<br />the events that led to his mother's suicide when he was just four, he discovers that Hannah's success came at<br />a price, and that the pressures she faced as she carved out her place in a man's world may have contributed to her death. Searching for the mother who was never talked about as he grew up, he discovers letters, diaries, and photos that paint a picture of a brilliant but complex young woman grappling to find an outlet for her creativity, sexuality, and intelligence.<br /><br /><br /><br /><i>A Woman on the Edge of Time</i> not only documents the too-short life of an extraordinary woman; it is a searching<br />examination of the suffocating constrictions in place on intelligent, ambitious women in the middle of the twentieth century.",3.68,5:47|4:121|3:68|2:20|1:8|total:264,188,26,272,Scribe UK,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1445379869l/27242577._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1445379869l/27242577._SX50_.jpg,1925228096,9781925228090,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27242577-a-woman-on-the-edge-of-time

Palmer,"•This e-book is illustrated as per original publication.<br /><br />•The images have been resized, digitally enhanced and optimized for a Kindle.<br /><br />•A new table of contents with working links has been included by a publisher.<br /><br />•Our edition contains the original punctuation of the first edition.<br /><br />An excerpt from the beginning of the book:<br /><br />These charts are prepared for popular use, rather than for students of botanical science; all technical terms are, therefore, as far as possible, avoided.<br />The names ""mushroom"" and ""toadstool"" are indefinite, are both applied with equal reason to any fleshy fungus, and are here used as synonymes, like the corresponding term ""plant"" and ""vegetable,"" or ""shrub"" and ""bush,"" in common conversation.<br />No general test can be given by which a poisonous mushroom may be distinguished from an edible mushroom. But each species of fungus has certain marks of identity, either in appearance, quality, or condition of growth, which are its own, and never radically varied; none can contain a venomous element at one time, and yet be harmless under other conditions. Like other food, animal or vegetable, however, mushrooms may, by decay or conditions of growth, be unfit for table use; yet in this state no fatality would attend such use.<br />Therefore the identification of species is a safe guide, and is the only means of knowing what mushrooms should be eaten, and what varieties of fungus should be rejected. Having once learned to distinguish any species of mushrooms as esculent, perfect security may be felt in the use of that species wherever and whenever found; but any specimen varying from the type in the slightest degree should be rejected by an amateur.<br />There are about one thousand varieties of mushrooms (exclusive of small or microscopic fungi) native to the United States; many will therefore be found which are not represented on either of these plates. Those here depicted are of three classes, namely, the Lycoperdaceæ, or Puff-ball fungi; the Agaricini, or Gill-bearing fungi; and the Boleti, which last is one division of the Polyporei, or Pore-bearing fungi.<br /><br />",3.61,5:7|4:5|3:6|2:5|1:0|total:23,21,0,,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12877365-mushrooms-of-america-edible-and-poisonous

Κριτική των τρεχουσών αντιλήψεων περί ποιητικής τέχνης και ποιητών. Το ποιητικό ταλέντο ως θείο χάρισμα. Ο ποιητής όργανο της θείας έμπνευσης που τον καταλαμβάνει.<br />Ο Πλάτων γεννήθηκε το 427 π.Χ., γόνος επιφανούς Αθηναϊκής οικογένειας. Έλαβε σπουδαία παιδεία και γνώρισε τα Ελληνικά φιλοσοφικά ρεύματα. Αυτό όμως που διαμόρφωσε καθοριστικά την ηθική και πνευματική του υπόσταση ήταν ο Σωκράτης, με τη ζωή, τη φιλοσοφία και τον θάνατό του. Ο μεγάλος φιλόσοφος ήταν αιτία να στραφεί ο νεαρός Πλάτων στη φιλοσοφία, και η Σωκρατική εννοιολογία αποτέλεσε βάση για τη δημιουργία της κατοπινής Πλατωνικής θεωρίας των Ιδεών. Ο Πλάτων ερμήνευσε βαθύτατα τον Σωκράτη ως άνθρωπο και διδάσκαλο, και αποτύπωσε την προσωπικότητά του σε πολλά έργα του. Ταξίδεψε στην Αίγυπτο, την Κυρήνη και τη Μεγάλη Ελλάδα, όπου προσπάθησε, χωρίς επιτυχία να εφαρμόσει τις πολιτικές αρχές του στην οργάνωση των Ελληνικών πόλεων της Σικελίας. Το 387 π.Χ. ίδρυσε στην Αθήνα την Ακαδημία, περίφημο κέντρο της φιλοσοφίας και των Μουσών, που διατηρήθηκε σχεδόν δέκα αιώνες, μέχρι τους χρόνους του Ιουστινιανού. Ο Πλάτων αφοσιώθηκε ως το θάνατό του (348 π.Χ) στη διδασκαλία και τη συγγραφή. Τα έργα του, που σώζονται όλα, ταξινόμησε ο Θράσυλλος σε εννέα τετραλογίες. Όλα σχεδόν ανήκουν στο είδος του διαλόγου, με το οποίο ο Πλάτων αναδείχτηκε, εκτός από κορυφαίος φιλόσοφος, αληθινός ποιητής.

30749,3151802,Ringan Gilhaize: or The Covenanters,John Galt,"In a story which lays bare the strengths and the horrors of the egalitarian Scottish Presbyterian spirit, <i>Ringan Gilhaize</i> looks across three generations to describe Scotland’s most turbulent years, from his grandfather’s support for the Reformation, to the harsher years of his own sufferings as a persecuted Covenanter in the killing times.<br /><br />Unique when it was published in 1823, and unique to this day, <i>Ringan Gilhaize</i> is an autobiography, a folk history of enormous scope, and a compelling psychological portrait of how idealism can turn to fanaticism. History tells us that John Graham of Claverhouse (""bluidy Clavers"") was killed by a stray musket ball at the battle of Killiecrankie in 1689. This is the story of the bitter religious and political conflicts that led to that battle, from the mouth of the man who pulled the trigger. Galt shows the full range and power of his writing here and reinforces his claim to be in the very highest rank of Scottish writers.<br /><br />Introduced by Patricia J.

Donkersloot.,Multatuli,"""Woutertje Pieterse"" (or The History of Walter Pieterse) by Multatuli was his second novel and published posthumously in 1890. It is also the most famous work by the author after ""Max Havelaar."" The history of Wouter Pieterse appeared as fragments in the Ideas, which also forms an organic whole with it. The story is about a dreamy and poetic msterdam boy, Wouter Pieterse, who grows up in a middle-class environment in the French period . The philistinism of his surroundings and curiosity of Wouter often come into conflict, and forms the main theme of the book. Eduard Douwes Dekker (2 March 1820 - 19 February 1887), better known by his pen name Multatuli (from Latin multa tuli, ""I have suffered much""), was a Dutch writer famous for his satirical novel, Max Havelaar (1860), which denounced the abuses of colonialism in the Dutch East Indies (today's Indonesia).",3.57,5:32|4:70|3:60|2:20|1:4|total:186,1,0,645,"De Arbeiderspers, Amsterdam",nl,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1412679383l/23336892._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1412679383l/23336892._SX50_.jpg,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23336892-de-geschiedenis-van-woutertje-pieterse-opnieuw-uit-de-idee-n-verzameld

30762,364251,Der Moses des Michelangelo. Schriften über Kunst und Künstler (Psychologie),Sigmund Freud,"Freuds Beziehung zur Kunst ist nicht das Überbleibsel schöngeistiger Gymnasiastenschwärmereien oder bildungsbürgerliche Konvention. Vielmehr hat er, wie der renommierte Freud-Forscher und Kulturhistoriker Peter Gay in der Einleitung zeigt, die Künstler schon früh als unentbehrliche intellektuelle Helfer auf dem Wege zur Entdeckung des Unbewußten aufgefaßt. In voller Absicht gab er dem Kernkomplex der Neurosen bzw. dem unumgänglichen Durchgangsstadium in der seelischen Entwicklung eines jeden Menschen den mythologisch-literarischen Namen »Ödipus-Komplex«. Denn Freud war davon überzeugt, daß bereits Sophokles in der äußersten Verdichtung seiner Tra-gödie die kindliche Liebe bzw. den kindlichen Haß gegenüber den Elternfiguren dargestellt habe - ebenso sei Shakespeares ›Hamlet‹, in Goethes ›Faust‹ oder in Dostojewskis ›Brüder Karamasoff‹ »die unvergleichliche Stärke der ersten affektiven Bindungen des Menschenkindes« vorgeführt. In gewissem Sinne hat sich Freud also als Nacharbeiter der großen Künstler gesehen: was diese vorbewußt immer schon erahnten, hat er in die rationale Sprache der Wissenschaft gefaßt und voll bewußtgemacht. Die in diesem Band versammelten Schriften, darunter essayistische Glanzstücke, überraschen durch die Vielfalt der Gesichtspunkte. Nicht nur werden bestimmte Kunstwerke interpretiert - etwa die Moses-Statue des Michelangelo, die einen anderen Moses verkörpere als den jähzornigen der biblischen Überlieferung -, auch einzelne Künstler werden vorsichtig biographisch-analytischer Betrach-tung unterzogen - beispielsweise Dostojewski mit seiner Spielerleidenschaft; wo Diskretionsrücksichten die Veröffentlichung klinischen Materials ausschlössen, konnte Freud neu entdeckte Mechanismen überzeugend an literarischen Figuren demonstrieren, so den Typen des »am Erfolge Scheiternden« an Shakespeares Lady Macbeth oder Ibsens Rebekka West, oder aber er illustrierte die besonderen Bedingungen dafür, daß wir etwas als »unheimlich« empfinden, an E.T.A. Hoffmanns Erzählung ›Der Sandmann‹ durch den Vergleich mit dem Spiel des Kindes und dem Tragträumen des Erwachsenen gewinnt Freud schließlich tiefe Einblicke in die Gesetzmäßigkeiten des künstlerischen Produzierens überhaupt. In löblicher Selbstentscheidung hat er sich übrigens nie angemaßt, etwas über die ›formalen‹ Aspekte von Kunst aussagen zu können.",3.73,5:8|4:23|3:4|2:3|1:3|total:41,26,1,216,Fischer (Frankfurt),ger,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,3596104564,9783596104567,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/364251.Der_Moses_des_Michelangelo_Schriften_ber_Kunst_und_K_nstler

Le sere passate a leggere insieme libri gialli portano Alex a cimentarsi nella scrittura, ed è già dai primi racconti che la ragazza dimostra di avere un talento innato. Eric, il suo primo sostenitore, la incoraggia a seguire la sua dote, mettendola però in guardia: pochi crederebbero che una giovane donna possa essere l'autrice di storie tanto terrificanti, e molti uomini ne sarebbero invidiosi. Per questo, se in futuro vorrà continuare a scrivere, le suggerisce di usare uno pseudonimo maschile. Nel tempo, Alex non abbandona mai la sua passione, e anche il dolore per la morte del padre trova sfogo sul foglio di carta. La ragazza scrive in ogni momento libero, dando vita a trame, temi e personaggi che popolano la sua mente. Così, a metà college finisce il suo primo romanzo, che incontra subito l'interesse di un editore. Ricordando il monito del padre, la ragazza sceglie di pubblicare sotto lo pseudonimo di Alexander Green, e il suo libro diventa subito un bestseller.

Cooke,"Excerpt from Nature Myths and Stories for Little Children<br /><br />And when we consider that here, too, is the key which unlocks so much of the best in art and litera ture, we feel that we cannot rank too highly the importance of the myth in the primary schoolroom.<br /><br />For instance the child has been observing, read ing, and writing about the sun, the moon, the direction of the wind, the trees, the ﬂowers, or the forces that are acting around him. He has had the songs, poems, and pictures connected with these lessons to further enhance his thought, inter est, and observation.<br /><br />He is, now given a beautiful myth.

  <i>'Liberty, equality, fraternity, or death; -- the last, much the easiest to bestow, O Guillotine!'</i>
</b><br /><br />After eighteen years as a political prisoner in the Bastille, the ageing Doctor Manette is finally released and reunited with his daughter in England. There the lives of two very different men, Charles Darnay, an exiled French aristocrat, and Sydney Carton, a disreputable but brilliant English lawyer, become enmeshed through their love for Lucie Manette. From the tranquil roads of London, they are drawn against their will to the vengeful, bloodstained streets of Paris at the height of the Reign of Terror, and they soon fall under the lethal shadow of La Guillotine.<br /><br />This edition uses the text as it appeared in its serial publication in 1859 to convey the full scope of Dickens's vision, and includes the original illustrations by H. K. Browne ('Phiz').

30826,7624,Lord of the Flies,William Golding,"At the dawn of the next world war, a plane crashes on an uncharted island, stranding a group of schoolboys. At first, with no adult supervision, their freedom is something to celebrate; this far from civilization the boys can do anything they want. Anything. They attempt to forge their own society, failing, however, in the face of terror, sin and evil. And as order collapses, as strange howls echo in the night, as terror begins its reign, the hope of adventure seems as far from reality as the hope of being rescued. Labeled a parable, an allegory, a myth, a morality tale, a parody, a political treatise, even a vision of the apocalypse, Lord of the Flies is perhaps our most memorable novel about “the end of innocence, the darkness of man’s heart.”",3.67,5:556558|4:697220|3:511791|2:191004|1:112630|total:2069203,1975135,25513,182,Penguin Books,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327869409l/7624._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327869409l/7624._SY75_.jpg,0140283331,9780140283334,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7624.Lord_of_the_Flies

He was also a diplomat, a traveller, a flying buff who officiated at the first British air meeting at Doncaster in 1909, and a wireless pioneer who broadcast music from his own station long before radio was generally available. He studied painting in Paris. He was foreign editor of The Globe newspaper during the 1890s. He subsequently wrote professionally. He reported on the First Balkan War. He wrote in the genres of mystery, thriller, and espionage, particularly in the years leading up to World War I. Apart from fiction he wrote extensively on wireless broadcasting, various travel works including An Observer in the Near East and several short books on Switzerland, and an unrevealing and often misleading autobiography, Things I Know About Kings, Celebrities and Crooks. He also wrote The Czar's Spy: The Mystery of a Silent Love (1905), The Four Faces: A Mystery (1914), The Minister of Evil (1918), The Doctor of Pimlico (1919), Mademoiselle of Monte Carlo (1921) and The Secret of the Fox Hunter.",2.50,5:1|4:0|3:3|2:2|1:2|total:8,5,1,260,Dodo Press,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1409992284,9781409992288,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8652219-the-count-s-chauffeur

Coetzee,"For decades the Magistrate has been a loyal servant of the Empire, running the affairs of a tiny frontier settlement and ignoring the impending war with the barbarians. When interrogation experts arrive, however, he witnesses the Empire's cruel and unjust treatment of prisoners of war. Jolted into sympathy for their victims, he commits a quixotic act of rebellion that brands him an enemy of the state.<br />J. M. Coetzee's prize-winning novel is a startling allegory of the war between oppressor and oppressed. The Magistrate is not simply a man living through a crisis of conscience in an obscure place in remote times; his situation is that of all men living in unbearable complicity with regimes that ignore justice and decency.",3.93,5:7134|4:9114|3:4884|2:1299|1:384|total:22815,17681,1008,152,Penguin Books,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1330879044l/6194._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1330879044l/6194._SX50_.jpg,0140283358,9780140283358,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6194.Waiting_for_the_Barbarians

I put up not just walls but whole stone bunkers to keep everyone out, emotionally, and physically as well. I was protected from people, from ghosts, from specters real and imagined. Sure, I was alone. But I felt safe. Only, after a while, I wasn't sure any longer whether a totally ""safe"" empty life was really worth living.<br />Then Tobin came along. Out of the blue, out of my past, with a summons from the king that he wouldn't let me ignore. I tried to cling to my isolation, but he wouldn't give up on me. Tobin never believed in walls.<br /><br />This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's ""<b>Love Has No Boundaries</b>"" event.

She had a way of standing in our midst, nodding around, and addressing us in what she imagined to be French: ""Bienne, hommes! ca va bienne?"" I took the freedom to reply in the same lingo: ""Bienne, femme! ca va couci-couci tout d'meme, la bourgeoise!"" And at that, when we had all laughed, with a little more heartiness than was entirely civil, ""I told you he was quite an oddity!"" says she in triumph. Needless to say, these passages were before I had remarked the niece. The aunt came on the day in question with a following rather more than usually large, which she manoeuvred to and fro about the market and lectured to at rather more than usual length, and with rather less than her accustomed tact. I kept my eyes down, but they were ever fixed in the same direction, quite in vain.

30851,19386725,Fifteenth Century Prose and Verse,Various,"[...]translation, it seems to me that the tone of the reference already quoted, and the detailed account (see p. 194) which the translator gives of the method in which he went to work, compel us to seek an independent origin, and to look for some other translator less immediately under Wyclif's influence. The freedom with which the Bible admittedly circulated for many years, and the well-known allusion by Sir Thomas More to an English translation untouched by any taint of heresy, point also in the same direction. That the second version is really only a revision of the first can hardly be adduced as a strong argument on the other side.

A tall young woman with a big soft mouth, great masses of blue-black hair on either side of a broad, low forehead, and eyes of so dark brown you might have thought them black, drooped forward and surveyed the house with a mixture of keen appreciation and that gentle apprehension which is the shadow of desire in unassuming natures.

I could be willing to die, and could even die gladly, my darling, darling Dolores, if I could die with your hand in mine."" Ashby was going on farther in this pleasing strain, when suddenly, and without a moment's warning, Dolores gave a spring and vanished. Ashby stood confounded. Then he stared all around. Then he called another, ""Dolores! Dolores! Don't leave me!"" A voice came back through the gloom: ""H-s-s-s-h! I must not stay any longer."" ""But shall I never see you again?"" ""Certainly; I will come soon, and show you the passage-way."" ""Where are you?"" ""Never mind-good-night!"" ""Oh, Dolores, wait-one word more."" ""Be quick!"" said Dolores, and her voice now sounded nearer. ""You will see me again?"" said Ashby, in tones of entreaty. ""You will not fly and leave me all alone? You will not leave me in this way? I may be taken away from this room, Dolores, or you may be taken to another room; and then how can you get to me? Show me how you came here. You might do that much for me. Only think what dangers there are."" Dolores paused a moment. ""Well,"" said she, ""only promise one thing."" ""What?"" ""That you will not try to visit me. That would be dangerous. Others are with me."" ""I will not; I promise-except, of course, in cases of the greatest necessity."" ""If you do,"" said Dolores, ""I shall think that you have not come for me; I shall think it is for the English maiden. And now, come; I will show you the way."" Once more Dolores appeared through the gloom. CHAPTER XXVIII. IN WHICH ""HIS MAJESTY"" FALLS IN LOVE. Mrs. Russell's position was a very peculiar and a very trying one. From the remarks of ""His Majesty"" she had reason to believe that her beloved, yet unfortunate, husband had been found guilty of treason against that august monarch, and had been executed.

30870,45702937,The Works of Robert Louis Stevenson - Swanston Edition Vol. 11 (of 25),Robert Louis Stevenson,"The Works of Robert Louis Stevenson - Swanston Edition Vol. 11 (of 25) by Robert Louis Stevenson The 25th day of August, 1751, about two in the afternoon, I, David Balfour, came forth of the British Linen Company, a porter attending me with a bag of money, and some of the chief of these merchants bowing me from their doors. Two days before, and even so late as yestermorning, I was like a beggarman by the wayside, clad in rags, brought down to my last shillings, my companion a condemned traitor, a price set on my own head for a crime with the news of which the country rang. To-day I was served heir to my position in life, a landed laird, a bank-porter by me carrying my gold, recommendations in my pocket, and (in the words of the saying) the ball directly at my foot. There were two circumstances that served me as ballast to so much sail. The first was the very difficult and deadly business I had still to handle; the second, the place that I was in. The tall, black city, and the numbers and movement and noise of so many folk, made a new world for me, after the moorland braes, the sea-sands, and the still country-sides that I had frequented up to then. The throng of the citizens in particular abashed me. Rankeillor's son was short and small in the girth; his clothes scarce held on me; and it was plain I was ill qualified to strut in the front of a bank-porter. It was plain, if I did so, I should but set folk laughing, and (what was worse in my case) set them asking questions. So that I behoved to come by some clothes of my own, and in the meanwhile to walk by the porter's side, and put my hand on his arm as though we were a pair of friends. At a merchant's in the Luckenbooths I had myself fitted out: none too fine, for I had no idea to appear like a beggar on horseback; but comely and responsible, so that servants should respect me. Thence to an armourer's, where I got a plain sword, to suit with my degree in life. I felt safer with the weapon, though (for one so ignorant of defence) it might be called an added danger. The porter, who was naturally a man of some experience, judged my accoutrement to be well chosen. We are delighted to publish this classic book as part of our extensive Classic Library collection.

Abbott,"Abraham Lincoln raved that this series of historical biographies gave him ""just that knowledge of past men and events which I need. I have read them with the greatest interest. To them I am indebted for about all the historical knowledge I have."" Considered what we would now call ""young adult"" literature, this collection, first published between 1848 and 1871, was designed to present a clear, distinct, connected narrative of the lives of the great figures of world history, those people who have been most influential, at least as American pastor and historian JOHN STEVENS CABOT ABBOTT (1805-1877) saw it from his 19th-century perspective. Wildly popular and republished many times under different collected names, this replica set mimics the 1904 reprint known as the ""Makers of History"" series. It will delight students of history as well as show the scholar how history telling has changed over the last few centuries. More than 30 other volumes in the series are also available from Cosimo Classics This volume, dating from 1849, covers French monarch Maria Antoinette (1755-1793), from her pampered childhood and her marriage, at age 14, to the future king of France, to the mobs at Versailles, her imprisonment during the French Revolution, and her execution on the guillotine.",3.51,5:9|4:12|3:10|2:6|1:2|total:39,15,1,324,Cosimo Classics,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1605207691,9781605207698,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7550071-history-of-maria-antoinette

Here are talented tomboy and author-to-be Jo, tragically frail Beth, beautiful Meg, and romantic, spoiled Amy, united in their devotion to each other and their struggles to survive in New England during the Civil War.<br /><p>It is no secret that Alcott based <i>Little Women</i> on her own early life. While her father, the freethinking reformer and abolitionist Bronson Alcott, hobnobbed with such eminent male authors as Emerson, Thoreau, and Hawthorne, Louisa supported herself and her sisters with ""woman’s work,” including sewing, doing laundry, and acting as a domestic servant. But she soon discovered she could make more money writing. <i>Little Women</i> brought her lasting fame and fortune, and far from being the ""girl’s book” her publisher requested, it explores such timeless themes as love and death, war and peace, the conflict between personal ambition and family responsibilities, and the clash of cultures between Europe and America.</p>",4.06,5:622928|4:481214|3:275752|2:76750|1:35319|total:1491963,1429603,16130,449,Signet Classics,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1562690475l/1934._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1562690475l/1934._SY75_.jpg,0451529308,9780451529305,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1934.Little_Women

30893,20365291,The Little Book of the Flag,Eva March Tappan,"More than three hundred years ago a little sailing vessel set out from Holland, crossed the Atlantic Ocean, and followed down our coast from Greenland. Its captain, Henry Hudson, was in search of a quick and easy route to Asia, and when he entered the mouth of the river that is named for him, he hoped that he had found a strait leading to the Asiatic coast. He was disappointed in this, but the Indians welcomed him, the mountains were rich in forests, and the ground was fertile. ""It is the most beautiful land in all the world,"" declared the enthusiastic navigator. Henry Hudson was an Englishman, but he sailed in the employ of the Dutch East India Company, and soon the flag of this Company was well known along the Hudson River. It was the old flag of Holland, three horizontal stripes, of orange, white, and blue, with the initials of the Company on the white stripe. Hudson had not found a new route to Asia, but he had opened the way for the fur-trade. In a few years the Dutch had established trading-posts as far north as Albany. They had also founded a city which we call ""New York,"" but which they named ""New Amsterdam."" So it was that in 1609 the Dutch flag first came to the New World.",5.00,5:1|4:0|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:1,0,0,50,Createspace,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1490946470,9781490946474,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20365291-the-little-book-of-the-flag

30902,6276179,"The Expediter (Kirk McGarvey, #13)",David Hagberg,"Late one balmy summer evening in Pyongyang, an important Chinese intelligence general on his way to a secret meeting with Kim Jon-Il is assassinated in plain sight of a surveillance camera. The two shooters are wearing the uniforms of North Korean police officers.  Kim Jong-Il denies any knowledge of the shooting, but the Chinese do not believe him. As they prepare to attack, Jong-Il promises to unleash his nuclear weapons on downtown Beijing, Seoul, and Tokyo, plunging the entire region into nuclear war.  Kirk McGarvey, just off a difficult assignment that took him to Mexico City, has returned to his visiting professorship at the University of South Florida. A colonel in North Korea's intelligence service shows up in person, asking McGarvey to prove that North Korea did not authorize the hit.  It's the most extraordinary request McGarvey has ever received. He enters a dangerous international shadow world where almost nothing is as it seems. The puzzles lead him to a mysterious Russian ex-KGB multimillionaire whose specialty is expediting assassins for hire, to Pyongyang where he finds the wedge to open up a far-reaching plot so monstrous the entire world could go up into flames, and finally back to the one nation that potentially has the most to gain by such a war. And the most to lose . . .",3.92,5:79|4:134|3:62|2:8|1:8|total:291,218,21,352,Forge Books,en-US,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1316125906l/6276179._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1316125906l/6276179._SY75_.jpg,0765311119,9780765311115,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6276179-the-expediter

There is no tired formula: dicovering a body or any crime, no romance, no time wasted on external activities or characters. We plunge straightforwardly into a pure mystery that chugs uninterrupted, to an emotional conclusion. <i>Cynthia &amp; Joyce</i> are best friends in high school, whose homes are solely separated by a disused house. Strangely, it has legally been kept empty for so many decades uncounted, that no one can explain it. At last, the girls endeavour to explore the house and find its contents astonishing.<br /><br />Sounding nothing at all like an adventure published 100 years before our time, it is a must read for any mystery or adventure-lover. It is deemed a valuable record of literary heritage and thus, an electronic scan of <b>Augusta Huiell Seaman's</b> ""<b>The Boarded-Up House</b>"" is available entirely for free!",3.83,5:11|4:15|3:12|2:3|1:0|total:41,31,8,217,The Century Company,eng,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10111967-the-boarded-up-house

This memorable novel breaches the walls of time, bringing readers to a young America, where romance and danger are as powerful as the wilderness. <br /><br />Set in 1797, on America's romantic frontier, this gripping journey of danger, heartache, and passion is the story of Stephen Wyllie, and his heroic and breathtaking quest for land-across a thousand perilous miles to the Kentucky wilderness-a new world for the brave. Stephen wants only one thing more than land-to keep his wife Jane and their young daughters safe. But he needs land to make a better future for his family, and the frontier lies open to settlement in the new state of Kentucky. He must make a difficult decision-choose between the comfort and safety of their New Hampshire home and his dream for their future. Can he risk exposing them to the dangers of the wilderness? Then an immediate threat makes the decision clear. A vicious half-Indian killer, Bomazeen, begins to haunt the area, stealing slaves for the Algonquians to replace those lost to smallpox. Having glimpsed her great beauty from afar, the cunning slave trader tantalizes the tribe's virulent Chief, Wanalancet, describing his next target-Jane.<br /><br />Believing the merciless slave trader may soon succeed in kidnapping or murdering Jane, Stephen decides his family must leave for Kentucky with his four brothers. When the harsh demands of the frontier nearly tear apart their great love, Stephen and Jane must find a path through more than the wilderness. His courage is undaunted, her passion is deep, but the wilderness is full of terror. Two lives. One great love. Torn apart by a frightening wilderness. <br /><br />A fresh, unblinkingly gritty, and deft new writer of intelligent heart-pounding romance novels, Dorothy Wiley's new American Wilderness Romance Series captivates readers by balancing the hardships of the frontier with amusing, romantic, and vivid characters. Join her as she robustly blends adventure and action, heartache and humor, with romance and passion.",4.14,5:298|4:165|3:83|2:29|1:24|total:599,119,32,366,,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1409786735l/22968182._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1409786735l/22968182._SY75_.jpg,1497393582,9781497393585,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22968182-wilderness-trail-of-love

Our staff has thoroughly reviewed every page of all the books in the collection, repairing, or if necessary, rejecting titles that are not of the highest quality. This process ensures that the reader of one of Trieste Publishing's titles receives a volume that faithfully reproduces the original, and to the maximum degree possible, gives them the experience of owning the original work.We pride ourselves on not only creating a pathway to an extensive reservoir of books of the finest quality, but also providing value to every one of our readers.

A stiff wind, that lashed the black waters of the Delaware into sullen fury and sent the snow whirling and eddying before it, blew savagely from the northeast. The snow, which had begun falling the day before, had continued all night with such rigorous, relentless persistence that by the noon hour the whole city was sheeted with a soft white blanket that spread abroad a solemn stillness. The rolling wheels of the few vehicles in the streets were noiseless, and the sharp ring and clatter of horses' hoofs became a dull muffled tramp. High up overhead the snow settled on the church spires, clothing them in a garb of pure cold white, and drifted among the niches of the State House Tower, until the face of the great clock was hidden, and could scarce be told for what it was.",5.00,5:3|4:0|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:3,3,0,456,The Penn Publishing Company,eng,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8683835-peggy-owen-and-liberty

30950,22087260,The Go Ahead Boys and the Treasure Cave,Ross Kay,"""A-a-ll ha-a-ands! Up anchor! A-ho-oy!"" Instantly all was bustle and action on board the brig Josephine. The sailors ran hither and thither, the sails were loosed and the yards braced. The clanking of the windlass soon told that the anchor was being raised. ""Whew! I never saw so much excitement and hurry in all my life,"" exclaimed a boy, who with three companions stood on the deck of the brig and looked on at these activities without actually taking part in them themselves. The speaker was Fred Button. He was a tiny little fellow, known affectionately among his friends as Stub, or Peewee or Pygmy. This last name was frequently shortened into Pyg, much to Fred's disgust, though he had learned better than to lose his temper because of teasing or little things that did not just suit him.

A thief had invaded the camp and unconsciously disclosed his presence in this loud-tongued brazen fashion. It was now up to them to appear hastily on the scene and add to his alarm in every way possible. So acting in concert they all started to crawl out from under the canvas, Jack clutching the double-barrel shotgun in his hand. 88 CHAPTER XI THE RASCALLY THIEF Could any one blame those boys for feeling highly worked up just about that time when they were hustling to get outside the canvas shelter, and see what strange things were taking place? The din created by the sudden fall of the bunch of tin pans was still ringing in their ears. And doubtless all manner of wildly exaggerated ideas must be crowding their brains in that same brief space of time. Each had something to do in the general line of self-defense as arranged for in case such an event transpired while they slept. There was Jack holding the gun as became the leader of the flock. Behind, and crowding close upon his heels, came Steve, bearing his jolly big club, with which he felt able to flay even a wildcat, and he had quite a notion, too, along that same line. Toby brought up the rear, not because of any undue timidity on his part, but because somebody had to ""take the drumstick,"" as his father was wont to say when they had turkey, and in this case all of them could not be either first or second; so Toby guarded the rear. He grasped the flashlight in a trembling hand, 89 and his orders were to make use of it just when Jack gave the word. The night was dark, very dark, in fact. The old moon had not yet put in an appearance in the eastern sky, which went to prove how aged and dilapidated it must indeed be to rise at such a late hour.

Then, in possession of the knowledge that Mallory was embarking into the past as Sir Galahad, all Perfidion had had to do was to consult one of the many experts he kept at his beck and call. The expert had undoubtedly told him where Sir Galahad was supposed to have found the Grail before taking it to Sarras, and, equally as important, approximately when the event was supposed to have taken place. Further questions could not have failed to elicit the additional information that Sir Launcelot had come to the chamber of the Sangraal before Sir Galahad had, and from this Perfidion had undoubtedly deduced that Sir Launcelot could very well have been a time-thief in disguise, too, and that the man, having arrived on the scene first, could very well have been responsible for the Grail's so-called return to Heaven, despite what legend said to the contrary. Certainly it had been a gamble worth taking, and obviously Perfidion had taken it. And won the jackpot. But that didn't mean he was going to keep the jackpot. Not by a long shot. Mallory encephalopathed Easy Money to his side and pulled himself to his feet with the help of the left stirrup and hung his helmet on the pommel. Then he picked up his spear and clambered into the saddle. ""We're not beat yet, Easy Money,"" he said. Giddy-ap! Easy Money whinnied, stamped its feet, and started back toward the Yore. A short while later they passed the lane that led to the castle of Carbonek. Presently Mallory heard the clip-clop of approaching hoofbeats, and not wanting to risk an encounter in his weakened condition, he encephalo-guided the rohorse off the highway and into the deep shadows of a big oak. There was something tantalizingly familiar about the horse and rider coming down the highway. Small wonder: the ""horse"" was Easy Money and the rider was himself. He was on his way to the castle of Carbonek to lift the Holy Grail. Mallory gazed after his retreating figure disgustedly.

30966,8817705,Miss Mouse And Her Boys,Mrs. Molesworth,"Mary Louisa Molesworth (1839-1921) was a Scottish writer. Her first novels, Lover and Husband (1869) to Cicely (1874), appeared under the pseudonym of ""Ennis Graham. "" She typified late Victorian writing for girls. Aimed at girls too old for fairies and princesses but too young for Austen and the Brontes, books by Molesworth had their share of amusement, but they also had a good deal of moral instruction. The girls reading Molesworth would grow up to be mothers; thus, the books emphasized Victorian notions of duty and self-sacrifice. She is best known as a writer of books for the young, such as Tell Me a Story (1875), Carrots (1876), The Cuckoo Clock (1877), The Tapestry Room: A Child's Romance (1879), and A Christmas Child (1880). She has been called ""the Jane Austen of the nursery, "" while The Carved Lions (1895) is probably her masterpiece. Her other works include: Rosy (1882), Us: An Old Fashioned Story (1885), and The Rectory Children (1889).",2.50,5:1|4:0|3:1|2:0|1:2|total:4,4,0,,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8817705-miss-mouse-and-her-boys

The author claims originality, as to the discovery of facts and principles, in but few cases. During ten years of preparatory study for this work, he has sought the rewards of industry, in sifting out the certain and the useful from the hypothetical and the fanciful, and the results of judicious discrimination between fallacy and just reasoning, in support of theories. This volume is designed to be a complete manual for all but amateur cultivators. While it is believed that he who follows its directions will be certain of success, it is not intended to disparage the merits of other works, but to encourage and extend their perusal. We can not too strongly recommend to young culturists to keep themselves well posted in this kind of literature, and give to every discovery and invention in this science a fair trial; not on a large scale, so as to sink money in fruitless experiments, but sufficient to afford a sure test of their real value. To no class of men is study more important than to soil-culturists.",0.00,5:0|4:0|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:0,0,0,316,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1525521767l/40005347._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1525521767l/40005347._SX50_.jpg,1717278523,9781717278524,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40005347-soil-culture

30979,8810428,Nuala O'Malley,H. Bedford-Jones,"The horseman reined in as his jaded steed scrambled up the shelving bank, and for a space sat there motionless, for which the horse gave mute thanks. The moon was struggling to heave through fleecy clouds, as it was hard on midnight; in the half obscurity the rider gazed around suspiciously. There was nothing in sight to cause any man fear. Behind him rippled the Dee, and all around was desolation. Ardee itself lay a good two miles in the rear, burned and laid waste six weeks before, and ten miles to the south lay Drogheda. Indeed, as the horseman gazed about, he caught sight of a faint glare on the horizon that drew a bitter word from his lips. Dismounting with some difficulty, owing to his cloak and Spanish hat, he examined a long, raking gash in his horse's flank; then flung off hat and cloak and calmly proceeded to bind up his own naked shoulder beneath. His was a strange figure, indeed, now that he stood revealed. He wore no clothing save breeches and high riding-boots; an enormous sword without a sheath was girt about his waist, and the caked blood on his shoulder and cheek made his fair skin stand out with startling contrast.",4.25,5:1|4:3|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:4,4,1,,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8810428-nuala-o-malley

30982,1420,Hamlet,William Shakespeare,"Among Shakespeare's plays, ""Hamlet"" is considered by many his masterpiece. Among actors, the role of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, is considered the jewel in the crown of a triumphant theatrical career. Now Kenneth Branagh plays the leading role and co-directs a brillant ensemble performance. Three generations of legendary leading actors, many of whom first assembled for the Oscar-winning film ""Henry V"", gather here to perform the rarely heard complete version of the play. This clear, subtly nuanced, stunning dramatization, presented by The Renaissance Theatre Company in association with ""Bbc"" Broadcasting, features such luminaries as Sir John Gielgud, Derek Jacobi, Emma Thompson and Christopher Ravenscroft. It combines a full cast with stirring music and sound effects to bring this magnificent Shakespearen classic vividly to life. Revealing new riches with each listening, this production of ""Hamlet"" is an invaluable aid for students, teachers and all true lovers of Shakespeare - a recording to be treasured for decades to come.",4.02,5:256879|4:224151|3:136527|2:36817|1:12236|total:666610,591585,6903,289,Cambridge University Press,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1351051208l/1420._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1351051208l/1420._SY75_.jpg,0521618746,9780521618748,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1420.Hamlet

31005,183217,The Coquette,Hannah Webster Foster,"The Coquette tells the much-publicized story of the seduction and death of Elizabeth Whitman, a poet from Hartford, Connecticut.<br /><br />Written as a series of letters--between the heroine and her friends and lovers--it describes her long, tortuous courtship by two men, neither of whom perfectly suits her. Eliza Wharton (as Whitman is called in the novel) wavers between Major Sanford, a charming but insincere man, and the Reverend Boyer, a bore who wants to marry her. When, in her mid-30s, Wharton finds herself suddenly abandoned when both men marry other women, she willfully enters into an adulterous relationship with Sanford and becomes pregnant. Alone and dejected, she dies in childbirth at a roadside inn. Eliza Wharton, whose real-life counterpart was distantly related to Hannah Foster's husband, was one of the first women in American fiction to emerge as a real person facing a dilemma in her life. In her Introduction, Davidson discusses the parallels between Elizabeth Whitman and the fictional Eliza Wharton. She shows the limitations placed on women in the 18th century and the attempts of one woman to rebel against those limitations.",3.31,5:269|4:654|3:871|2:359|1:73|total:2226,2047,129,169,"Oxford University Press, U.S.A.",eng,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,0195042395,9780195042399,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/183217.The_Coquette

31009,26057026,If At First You Don't Succeed,K.C. Faelan,"Take one clueless, newbie Dom, and his chatty, bratty bottom, and you have a recipe for disaster. Evan Marshall and his boyfriend, Julien Bouvet, are madly in love and have decided to spice up their sex life with kink. Unfortunately, it’s not going quite as planned. Will they survive their kinky adventures? And will someone come along who can help guide them on their journey?<br /><br /><br />****<br /><br /><br />First published as part of the Love's Landscapes Anthology<br />(DRiTC 2014, MMRomanceGroup), based on the prompt:<br /><br /><br />Dear Author,<br /><br /><br />My boyfriend and I have always played it safe, but recently we’ve tried to experiment with some of the more extreme aspects of the sexual realm. Well, extreme for us. Unfortunately, things haven’t always gone our way. We’re both a little awkward and geeky, but we like to flirt with “danger” (as long as it’s safe). For instance, our scene with chains turned into a giggle-fest because they were too cold. And don’t even get me started on what happened when we tried exhibitionism.<br /><br /><br />Now, here I am trying to get into my brand new leather pants because I’m supposed to be playing the role of Dom, while my boyfriend is all tied up in the bedroom. I can’t exactly go out there like this.<br /><br /><br />Please help us find our way in this brave new world, but make sure we have fun along the way.<br /><br /><br />***I envision this story describing some interesting scenes where these two figure out what “does” work for them. However, I’m pretty open for anything. You can make this as wild or tame as you like as long as it keeps a certain level of comedic charm. These two are in love and trust each other, so I don’t have any issues if they want to try a threesome (or more) or other playfulness. But mostly, you can just take this in any direction you want. Have fun!<br /><br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Lisa T",3.62,5:43|4:83|3:75|2:17|1:6|total:224,31,7,62,K.C.

Washington, and set out to find a way to use in his own life the values he had learned at Tuskeegee. He did not have to look far. Edwards toured Wilcox, Monroe, Butler, and Dallas counties and found a large black population in need of both liberal and practical education. Following the model set by Tuskegee, Edwards founded Snow Hill Institute in 1893 and was its principal and guiding hand for 31 years.<br /><br /><i>Twenty-Five Years in the Black Belt</i> is a memoir written by Edwards in 1918, when the school was 25 years old.

31068,3147367,American Lion: Andrew Jackson in the White House,Jon Meacham,"<b>The definitive biography of a larger-than-life president who defied norms, divided a nation, and changed Washington forever</b><br /><br />Andrew Jackson, his intimate circle of friends, and his tumultuous times are at the heart of this remarkable book about the man who rose from nothing to create the modern presidency. Beloved and hated, venerated and reviled, Andrew Jackson was an orphan who fought his way to the pinnacle of power, bending the nation to his will in the cause of democracy. Jackson's election in 1828 ushered in a new and lasting era in which the people, not distant elites, were the guiding force in American politics. Democracy made its stand in the Jackson years, and he gave voice to the hopes and the fears of a restless, changing nation facing challenging times at home and threats abroad. To tell the saga of Jackson's presidency, acclaimed author Jon Meacham goes inside the Jackson White House. Drawing on newly discovered family letters and papers, he details the human drama-the family, the women, and the inner circle of advisers- that shaped Jackson's private world through years of storm and victory.<br /><br />One of our most significant yet dimly recalled presidents, Jackson was a battle-hardened warrior, the founder of the Democratic Party, and the architect of the presidency as we know it. His story is one of violence, sex, courage, and tragedy. With his powerful persona, his evident bravery, and his mystical connection to the people, Jackson moved the White House from the periphery of government to the center of national action, articulating a vision of change that challenged entrenched interests to heed the popular will- or face his formidable wrath. The greatest of the presidents who have followed Jackson in the White House-from Lincoln to Theodore Roosevelt to FDR to Truman-have found inspiration in his example, and virtue in his vision.<br /><br />Jackson was the most contradictory of men. The architect of the removal of Indians from their native lands, he was warmly sentimental and risked everything to give more power to ordinary citizens. He was, in short, a lot like his country: alternately kind and vicious, brilliant and blind; and a man who fought a lifelong war to keep the republic safe-no matter what it took.",3.79,5:11006|4:14452|3:9363|2:2708|1:1452|total:38981,37665,1454,483,Random House,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320480904l/3147367._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320480904l/3147367._SY75_.jpg,1400063256,9781400063253,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3147367-american-lion

Inspired by the ""gusts of memory"" that rise up within him as he dips a Madeleine into hot tea, the narrator discusses his fear of going to bed at night. He is a creature of habit and dislikes waking up in the middle of the night not knowing where he is.<br /><br />He claims that people are defined by the objects that surround them and must piece together their identities bit by bit each time they wake up. The young Marcel is so nervous about sleeping alone that he looks forward to his mother's goodnight kisses, but also dreads them as a sign of an impending sleepless night. One night, when Charles Swann, a friend of his grandparents, is visiting, his mother cannot come kiss him goodnight. He stays up until Swann leaves and looks so sad and pitiful that even his disciplinarian father encourages ""Mamma"" to spend the night in Marcel's room.",4.14,5:19320|4:11444|3:5678|2:2152|1:1247|total:39841,40,6,1360,Wordsworth Editions Ltd,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1414350059l/863596._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1414350059l/863596._SY75_.jpg,1840221461,9781840221466,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/863596.Remembrance_of_Things_Past

General Pershing, Commander-in-Chief of the American Expeditionary Forces, has said that it was Gibbons' great opportunity to give the people in America a life-like picture of the work of the American soldier in France.

31107,10669865,Jeugdherinneringen,J.J. Voskuil,"Dit boek bevat jeugdherinneringen van J.J. Voskuil (1926–2008): dikwijls hilarisch opgeschreven en altijd helder en doeltreffend geformuleerd. Het verhaal 'Mijn socialistische jeugd', dat de hoofdmoot van dit boek vormt, is echter in de eerste plaats een even scherp als ontroerend portret van Voskuils vader. In de oorlogsjaren, Voskuil was 15 of 16 jaar oud, registreerde hij voor het eerst diens kwetsbaarheid: 'Hij verloor zijn gezag niet, maar hij kwam dichterbij en het gevoel dat hij mij beschermde, maakte geleidelijk plaats voor het gevoel dat hijzelf evengoed beschermd moet worden.' Er is een passage waarin zijn vader, met hulp van de buren, de meidoorn uit de voortuin omzaagt. Die passage vergeet je niet meer, zo mooi beschrijft Voskuil een vader die buiten de huiskamer niet zo sterk blijkt als zijn zoon zich hem voorstelt. Jeugdherinneringen bevat prachtige beschrijvingen van een jeugd in Den Haag. Niet eerder gepubliceerde foto's maken dit boek een must voor liefhebbers van J.J. Voskuil.<br /><br />Voor mensen die de grote werken Het Bureau en Bij nader inzien eerder niet aandurfden, is dit boekje een betrouwbare kennismaking. Want: succes verzekerd.

The couple moved to The Old Manse in Concord, Massachusetts, later moving to Salem, the Berkshires, then to The Wayside in Concord. The Scarlet Letter was published in 1850, followed by a succession of other novels. A political appointment took Hawthorne and family to Europe before their return to The Wayside in 1860. Hawthorne died on May 19, 1864, leaving behind his wife and their three children.<br /> <b>Much of Hawthorne's writing centers on New England, many works featuring moral allegories with a Puritan inspiration. His fiction works are considered part of the Romantic movement and, more specifically, dark romanticism. </b>His themes often center on the inherent evil and sin of humanity, and his works often have moral messages and deep psychological complexity. Even today, several of them are considered examples of the finest American literature.<br />",0.00,5:0|4:0|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:0,0,0,68,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1530096006,9781530096008,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29330190-the-scarlet-stigma

He wrote 150 books himself, and created the most famous of the series books for juveniles, including the Rover Boys (1899 and after), Bobbsey Twins (1904), Tom Swift (1910), Hardy Boys (1927), and Nancy Drew (1930) series, among others. In 1893, Stratemeyer was hired by the popular dime novel author Gilbert Patten to write for the Street &amp; Smith publication Good News. He pioneered the technique of producing long-running, consistent series of books using a team of freelance authors to write standardized novels, which were published under a pen name owned by his company. Through his Stratemeyer Syndicate, founded in 1906, Stratemeyer produced short plot summaries for the novels in each series, which he sent to other writers who completed the story, writing a specified number of pages and chapters. Each book would begin with an introduction of the characters and would be interrupted for a quick recap of all the previous books in the series.",4.50,5:1|4:1|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:2,1,0,216,Dodo Press,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1409991482,9781409991489,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9450229-young-auctioneers-or-the-polishing-of-a-rolling-stone

This is an OCR edition with typos. Excerpt from book: ZERVIAH HOPE. By Elizabeth Stuart Phelps. PRELUDE. IN the month of August, in the year 1878, the steamer Mercy, of the New York and Savannah line, cast anchor down the channel, off a little town in South Carolina which bore the name of Calhoun. It was not a regular part of her run for the Mercy to make a landing at this place. She had departed from her course by special permit to leave three passengers, two men and one woman, who had business of a grave nature in Calhoun. A man, himself a passenger for Savannah, came upon deck as the steamship hove to, to inquire the reason of the delay. He was a short man, thin, with a nervous hand and neck. His eyes were black, his hair was black, and closely cut. He had an inscrutable mouth, and a forehead well-plowed rather by experience than years. He was not anold man. He was cleanly dressed in new, cheap clothes. He had been commented upon as a reticent passenger. He had no friends on board the Mercy. This was the first time upon the voyage that he had been observed to speak. He came forward and stood among the others, and abruptly said: Scribntr's Monthly, November 1880. What's this for ? He addressed the mate, who answered with a sidelong look, and none too cordially: We land passengers by the Company's order. Those three ? Yes, the men and the lady. Who are they? Physicians from New York. Ah-h ! said the man, slowly, making a sighing noise between his teeth. That means?that means? Volunteers to the fever district, said the mate, shortly, as you might have known before now. You're not of a sociable cast, I see. I have made no acquaintances, said the short passenger. I know nothing of the news of the ship. Is the lady a nurse ? She's a she-doctor.

31199,39979550,Die letzten Tage des Patriarchats,Margarete Stokowski,"Dürfen Männer nach der feministischen Revolution Frauen noch die Tür aufhalten? Und sind Komplimente erlaubt? Die Gesellschaft scheint verunsichert. Zwar wehren sich überall auf der Welt Menschen gegen Sexismus und Belästigung. Doch Frauen verdienen immer noch weniger als Männer, dafür putzen und pflegen sie mehr und sterben am Ende ärmer. Margarete Stokowski legt den Finger in Wunden, die viele lieber ignorieren würden, denn Resignation ist für sie keine Lösung. Sie schreibt über Ungerechtigkeiten, an die wir uns längst gewöhnt haben, weil sie so alltäglich sind. Dabei geht es um Frauenkörper und wie sie kommentiert werden, um Pornos und Unisextoiletten, um #Metoo- und #Aufschrei-Debatten, aber auch um Rechtsextremismus und die Frage, warum sich Feminismus und Rassismus ausschließen. Margarete Stokowski ist eine der wichtigsten Stimmen des gegenwärtigen Feminismus. Ihre Texte machen Mut. Sie helfen, wütend zu bleiben, Haltung zu zeigen und doch den Humor nicht zu verlieren. Margarete Stokowski versammelt und kommentiert in diesem Buch die besten Essays und Kolumnen.",4.46,5:230|4:149|3:29|2:5|1:0|total:413,400,21,320,Rowohlt,ger,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1524856952l/39979550._SY160_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1524856952l/39979550._SY75_.jpg,3498063634,9783498063634,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39979550-die-letzten-tage-des-patriarchats

Catherine Smith, sitting on the top step of the porch of her home, Three Gables, bent her red-gold head over the pad of paper on her knee and wrote painfully, her forehead puckered earnestly.

All through the busy year, full of delightful new experiences, she had looked forward to the leisure of summer, in which she might adequately declare her devotion to the college which had been her mother's and was now her own. From the day, the June before, when she had gone there to visit her friend, Hannah Eldred, she had felt a keen sense of ""belonging,"" especially pleasant because her frail health had compelled her to lead a somewhat secluded life at home, and she had not felt really acquainted with the young people in the little town of Winsted, where she had always lived.",5.00,5:2|4:0|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:2,2,0,202,Dodo Press,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1409986659,9781409986652,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8079386-the-wide-awake-girls-in-winsted

The butler was new-he was always new, the doctor thought-and actually didn't know him. ""Mrs. Allen is at bridge, sir, with a party: she asks to be excused,"" he began mechanically. (""That's good!"" Stanchon felt tempted to say, ""and I hope the girls are out, too!"") As if in answer to this indiscretion, the new butler droned on: ""Miss Alida is at her riding-lesson and Miss Suzanne is-is engaged--"" (""Now, what particular infernal idiocy is Suzanne at, I wonder?"" Stanchon pondered, still smiling lightly at the butler and warming himself at every breath.) ""Mr. Edmund is-I think he could be found, sir,"" the voice went on. (""I don't doubt it,"" Stanchon agreed mentally, ""at the side board, no doubt; a nice time of day for a lad of twenty to be hanging about the house!"") But all he said was: ""I am the doctor. I called to see Miss Mary."" ""Oh!"" Even this new butler assumed a look of burdened intelligence; he leaned toward the visitor, ""Oh, yes, sir-Miss Mary. I understood that it wouldn't be possible for Miss Mary to see anybody, sir, but I suppose, the doctor--"" ""Certainly,"" said Stanchon curtly. ""Please send word to her nurse that I am here.""

31205,2340397,The Philosophy of Spinoza,Joseph Ratner,"Selections usually need no justifications. Some justification, however, of the treatment accorded Spinoza's Ethics may be necessary in this place. The object in taking the Ethics as much as possible out of the geometrical form, was not to improve upon the author's text; it was to give the lay reader a text of Spinoza he would find pleasanter to read and easier to understand. To the practice of popularization, Spinoza, one may confidently feel, would not be averse. He himself gave a short popular statement of his philosophy in the Political Treatise. The lay reader of philosophy is chiefly, if not wholly, interested in grasping a philosophic point of view. He is not interested in highly meticulous details, and still less is he interested in checking up the author's statements to see if the author is consistent with himself. He takes such consistency, even if unwarrantedly, for granted. A continuous reading of the original Ethics, even on a single topic, is impossible. The subject-matter is coherent, but the propositions do not hang together. By omitting the formal statement of the propositions; by omitting many of the demonstrations and almost all cross-references; by grouping related sections of the Ethics (with selections from the Letters and the Improvement of the Understanding) under sectional headings, the text has been made more continuous. It is the only time, probably, dismembering a treatise actually made it more unified.",3.55,5:5|4:19|3:13|2:4|1:1|total:42,37,5,377,Modern Library,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1389122717l/2340397._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1389122717l/2340397._SX50_.jpg,112230630X,9781122306300,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2340397.The_Philosophy_of_Spinoza

31217,8510638,Household Papers and Stories,Harriet Beecher Stowe,"Harriet Elizabeth Beecher Stowe (1811-1896) was an American author and abolitionist, famous for writing Uncle Tom's Cabin, first published in 1852. Stowe wrote the novel as an angry response to the 1850 passage of the second Fugitive Slave Act, which punished those who aided runaway slaves and diminished the rights of fugitives as well as freed slaves. It was the best-selling novel of the 19th century (and the second best-selling book of the century after the Bible) and is credited with helping to fuel the abolitionist cause in the United States prior to the American Civil War. When Stowe met Abraham Lincoln in 1862 (during the Civil War), he reportedly greeted her with, ""So you're the little woman who wrote the book that started this great war! "" Other works include: Sunny Memories of Foreign Lands (1854), Dred, A Tale of the Great Dismal Swamp (1856), The Minister's Wooing (1859), Lady Byron Vindicated (1870) and Pink and White Tyranny (1871).

This is an OCR edition with typos. Excerpt from book: CHAPTER III A DEAD MAN'S HAND I Had taken rooms temporarily at the Savoy Hotel, not knowing how long it might be ere I should be moved in spirit to desert London; and that night, instead of looking in at the club as I had meant, I went from the theatre straight to the hotel. There was a fire burning in my room, and I drew up a chair before it to smoke an unlimited number of cigarettes, and to think of Karine Cunningham. I had parted from Farnham outside the theatre, and had made an appointment to meet him next day at dinner, which he was to eat with me at my hotel. I felt no inclination for bed, nor was I in the least sleepy, and yet, before an hour had passed, I must have fallen into a doze. Suddenly I was awakened by the impression of having heard a sound. I looked round me, half dazed still from my dreams. The fire had died down, and I had left myself with no other light. Only a ruddy glow lingered on the hearth, and a small clock on the mantelpiece just above lightly chimed out the hour of two. I must have dreamed the sound, I told myself, for all was silent in the sleeping hotel, and even the rattle of cabs outside was dulled. Still, the impression lingered, and I could hardly persuade myself that I had not heard Harvey Farnham's voice calling my name, and finishing with a gurgling, despairing cry for help, the horror of which had chilled the blood in my veins, even in my sleep. Though the fire was dead, the room was still warm, and I hardly knew why I should be so cold. Nevertheless, I felt chilled to the bone, and I was glad enough to get into bed as quickly as I could. Several times I was on the point of falling asleep again, but, at just the critical point between reflectiveness ad sinking into the soft depths of slumber, I waked with an almost conv..",3.50,5:11|4:13|3:16|2:10|1:0|total:50,32,7,,General Books,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,0217350593,9780217350594,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7535669-the-house-by-the-lock

31236,7501962,"Bonhoeffer: Pastor, Martyr, Prophet, Spy",Eric Metaxas,"As Adolf Hitler and the Nazis seduced a nation, bullied a continent, and attempted to exterminate the Jews of Europe, a small number of dissidents and saboteurs worked to dismantle the Third Reich from the inside. One of these was Dietrich Bonhoeffer--a pastor and author, known as much for such spiritual classics as ""The Cost of Discipleship ""and ""Life Together,"" as for his 1945 execution in a concentration camp for his part in the plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler.<br /><br />In the first major biography of Bonhoeffer in forty years, ""New York Times"" best-selling author Eric Metaxas takes both strands of Bonhoeffer's life―the theologian and the spy―to tell a searing story of incredible moral courage in the face of monstrous evil. In a deeply moving narrative, Metaxas uses previously unavailable documents―including personal letters, detailed journal entries, and firsthand personal accounts―to reveal dimensions of Bonhoeffer's life and theology never before seen.<br /><br />In ""Bonhoeffer: Pastor, Martyr, Prophet, Spy""―""A Righteous Gentile vs the Third Reich,"" Metaxas presents the fullest accounting of Bonhoeffer's heart-wrenching 1939 decision to leave the safe haven of America for Hitler's Germany, and using extended excerpts from love letters and coded messages written to and from Bonhoeffer's Cell 92, Metaxas tells for the first time the full story of Bonhoeffer's passionate and tragic romance.<br /><br />Readers will discover fresh insights and revelations about his life-changing months at the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem and about his radical position on why Christians are obliged to stand up for the Jews. Metaxas also sheds new light on Bonhoeffer's reaction to Kristallnacht, his involvement in the famous Valkyrie plot and in ""Operation 7,"" the effort to smuggle Jews into neutral Switzerland.<br /><br />""Bonhoeffer"" gives witness to one man's extraordinary faith and to the tortured fate of the nation he sought to deliver from the curse of Nazism. It brings the reader face to face with a man determined to do the will of God radically, courageously, and joyfully―even to the point of death. ""Bonhoeffer"" is the story of a life framed by a passion for truth and a commitment to justice on behalf of those who face implacable evil.",4.21,5:26326|4:14974|3:5985|2:1994|1:1824|total:51103,46840,3105,608,Thomas Nelson,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1298218180l/7501962._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1298218180l/7501962._SX50_.jpg,1595551387,9781595551382,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7501962-bonhoeffer

31246,2379465,A Short Account of the History of Mathematics,W.W. Rouse Ball,"It's the classic resource on the history of math. From the early Greek influences to the Middle Ages and the Renaissance to the end of the 19th century, trace the fascinating foundation of mathematics as it developed through the ages. Aristotle, Galileo, Kepler, Newton: you know the names. Now here's what they really did, and the effect their discoveries had on our culture, all explained in a way the layperson can understand. Begin with the basis of arithmetic (Plato and the introduction of geometry), and discover why the use of Arabic numerals was critical to the development of both commerce and science. The development of calculus made space travel a reality, while the abacus prefigured the computer.

It was like a dream. They couldn't believe it, nor understand it. It seemed as if they lived in a palace. They had three parlors furnished in the most costly and elegant style. There were yellow satin chairs in one room and blue in the next. Obsequious servants waited upon their every want. Camilla's room looked out on Broadway and the view from the window afforded her unending amusement She hardly dared to sit in the satin chairs. They were almost too fine for use. Such splendor and luxury was really oppressive. And the people! What a strange language they spoke. She was sure she could never understand it. She listened and tried and only succeeded in pronouncing the 74 name of the hotel which she gave as the ""Ir-ving House."" The first few days they gave themselves up to sight seeing. The American called frequently and said that the first concert would come off very soon. He had advertised it extensively and the whole troupe must prepare for the great event. In the meantime they must be prepared to receive company, for the authorities would soon call upon them. This they thought would be quite proper and they felt sure they would receive the dignitaries of the city with becoming respect. In order to give a proper variety to Camilla's concerts other talent had been engaged. Oscar Comettant and his wife had been invited by the American to join the troupe. He was to assist as accompanist and his wife was to sing. There was also a M. Fetlinger a buffo singer. This enabled them to present with Camilla's assistance the best of programmes. While they were thus waiting at the Irving House for their first concert, the whole party M. and Madam Comettant, M. Urso, Camilla, and Aunt Caroline all went out to walk one bright sunny morning.

31274,556321,Lady Anna,Anthony Trollope,"When it appeared in 1874 ""Lady Anna"" met with little success, and positively outraged readers, but Trollope staunchly defended the novel. It is a tightly constructed and passionate study of enforced marriage in the world of Radical politics and social inequality. ""Lady Anna"" records the lifelong attempt of Countess Lovel to justify her claim to her title, and her daughter Anna's legitimacy, after her husband announces that he already has a wife. Anna falls in love with the journeyman tailor and young Radical Daniel Thwaite, but her mother wishes her to marry her cousin, heir to her father's title. Can Anna be allowed - can she allow herself - to change her mind? Though the conclusion is a foregone one, Trollope's ambivalence on the question is profound, and the novel both intense and powerful.<br /><br />Excerpt from Lady Anna:<br />Of course She told her father. Of course she invoked every Murray in and out of Scotland. Of course there were many threats. A duel was fought up near London, in which Lord Lovel consented to be shot at twice, - declaring that after that he did not think that the circumstances of the case required that he Should be shot at any more. In the midst of this a daughter was born to her and her father died, - during which time She was still allowed to live at Lovel Grange. But what was it expedient that she should do? He declared that he had a former wife when he married her, and that therefore she was not and could not be his wife. Should she institute a prosecution against him for bigamy, thereby acknowledging that She was herself no wife and that her Child was illegitimate? From such evidence as she could get, She believed that the Italian woman whom the earl in former years had married had died before her own marriage. The earl declared that the countess, the real countess, had not paid her debt to nature, till some months after the little ceremony which had taken place in Apple thwaite Church.

31275,8748458,"Letters to Eugenia; Or, a Preservative Against Religious Prejudices",Paul Henri Thiry,"Paul-Henri Thiry, Baron d'Holbach (1723-1789) was a French-German author, philosopher, encyclopedist and a prominent figure in the French Enlightenment. He was born Paul Heinrich Dietrich in Edesheim, near Landau in the Rhenish Palatinate, but lived and worked mainly in Paris, where he kept a salon. He is best known for his atheism, and for his voluminous writings against religion, the most famous of them being the System of Nature (1770). For the Encyclopedie d'Holbach authored and translated a large number of articles on topics ranging from politics and religion to chemistry and mineralogy. As a German who had become a naturalised Frenchman, he undertook the translation of many contemporary German works of natural philosophy into French. All in all, between 1751 and 1765 he contributed some four hundred articles to the project, mostly on scientific subjects, in addition to serving as the editor of several volumes on natural philosophy. D'Holbach may also have written several disparaging entries on non-Christian religions, intended as veiled criticisms of Christianity itself.",4.31,5:8|4:6|3:1|2:1|1:0|total:16,4,1,200,Dodo Press,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1409992586,9781409992585,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8748458-letters-to-eugenia-or-a-preservative-against-religious-prejudices

31278,7550732,The History of Freedom and Other Essays,John Emerich Edward Dalberg-Acton,"Formerly known as Lord Acton, John E.E. Dalberg Acton was one of the great historians of the Victorian period and one of the greatest classical historians of all time. His life's work was advancing the history of liberty though he was never able to complete his magnum opus. THE HISTORY OF FREEDOM AND OTHER ESSAYS consists of articles reprinted from various journals of his time. Acton's other works include Lectures on Modern History (1906) and Historical Essays and Studies (1907), which were brought to light after his death. JOHN E.E. DALBERG ACTON (1834-1902), English scholar and historian, was denied entrance into Cambridge University because of his Roman Catholicism; he traveled to Munich, where he studied with Fr. Johann Joseph Ignaz von Dollinger. In 1895, Acton was appointed Professor of Modern History at Cambridge where he was known for his lectures, his writings for periodicals, and his personal contacts with the leading historians of the era. His impressive personal library - consisting of more than 59,000 volumes - was acquired by financier Andrew Carnegie and donated to Cambridge University.""",3.80,5:2|4:4|3:4|2:0|1:0|total:10,3,1,680,Cosimo Classics,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1602069344,9781602069343,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7550732-the-history-of-freedom-and-other-essays

31287,8180873,Turnover Point,Alfred Coppel,"Every era in history has had its Pop Ganlon's. Along in years and not successful and not caring much anyway. A matter of living out their years, following an obscure path to oblivion. It was that way in ancient Egypt, just as it will be when the Solar System shrinks to our size. And once in a while such men are given an opportunity to contribute to the society that has forgotten them.... Pop Ganlon was no hero—he was only a spaceman. A spaceman and a father. In fact, Pop was rather no-account, even in a profession that abounded with drifters. He had made a meagre living prospecting asteroids and hauling light freight and an occasional passenger out in the Belt Region. Coffee and cakes, nothing more. Not many people knew Pop had a son in the Patrol, and even fewer knew it when the boy was blasted to a cinder in a back alley in Lower Marsport. Pop went on eating and breathing, but his life was over after that. He hit the bottle a little harder and his ship, The Luck, grew rustier and tackier, and those were the only outward signs that Pop Ganlon was a living dead man. He kept on grubbing among the cold rocks and pushing The Luck from Marsport to Callisto and back with whatever low-mass payloads he could pick up. He might have lived out his string of years like that, obscure and alone, if it hadn't been for John Kane. Kane was Pop Ganlon's ticket to a sort of personal immortality—if there is such a thing for an old spaceman",3.25,5:1|4:2|3:3|2:2|1:0|total:8,4,0,,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8180873-turnover-point

31308,20344514,The Invisible Orientation: An Introduction to Asexuality,Julie Sondra Decker,"What if you weren't sexually attracted to anyone?<br /><br />A growing number of people are identifying as asexual. They aren't sexually attracted to anyone, and they consider it a sexual orientation—like gay, straight, or bisexual.<br /><br />Asexuality is the invisible orientation. Most people believe that ""everyone"" wants sex, that ""everyone"" understands what it means to be attracted to other people, and that ""everyone"" wants to date and mate. But that's where asexual people are left out—they don't find other people sexually attractive, and if and when they say so, they are very rarely treated as though that's okay.<br /><br />When an asexual person comes out, alarming reactions regularly follow; loved ones fear that an asexual person is sick, or psychologically warped, or suffering from abuse. Critics confront asexual people with accusations of following a fad, hiding homosexuality, or making excuses for romantic failures. And all of this contributes to a discouraging master narrative: there is no such thing as ""asexual."" Being an asexual person is a lie or an illness, and it needs to be fixed.<br /><br />In <i>The Invisible Orientation</i>, Julie Sondra Decker outlines what asexuality is, counters misconceptions, provides resources, and puts asexual people's experiences in context as they move through a very sexualized world. It includes information for asexual people to help understand their orientation and what it means for their relationships, as well as tips and facts for those who want to understand their asexual friends and loved ones.",4.06,5:315|4:318|3:151|2:39|1:13|total:836,685,144,216,Carrel Books,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1411447547l/20344514._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1411447547l/20344514._SY75_.jpg,1631440020,9781631440021,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20344514-the-invisible-orientation

With Aelyx, her L’eihr boyfriend, back on Earth, working to mend the broken alliance between their two planets, Cara is left to fend for herself at a new school, surrounded by hostile alien clones. Even the weird dorm pet hates her.<br /><br />Things look up when Cara is appointed as human representative to a panel preparing for a human colony on L’eihr. A society melding their two cultures is a place where Cara and Aelyx could one day make a life together. But with L’eihr leaders balking at granting even the most basic freedoms, Cara begins to wonder if she could ever be happy on this planet, even with Aelyx by her side.<br /><br />Meanwhile, on Earth, Aelyx, finds himself thrown into a full-scale PR campaign to improve human-L’eihr relations. Humans don’t know that their very survival depends on this alliance: only Aelyx’s people have the technology to fix the deadly contamination in the global water supply that human governments are hiding. Yet despite their upper hand, the leaders of his world suddenly seem desperate to get humans on their side, and hardly bat an eye at extremists’ multiple attempts on Aelyx’s life.<br /> <br />The Way clearly needs humans’ help . . . but with what?

31344,28436357,Mathematical Geography,Willis E Johnson,"In the greatly awakened interest in the common-school subjects during recent years, geography has received a large share. The establishment of chairs of geography in some of our greatest universities, the giving of college courses in physiography, meteorology, and commerce, and the general extension of geography courses in normal schools, academies, and high schools, may be cited as evidence of this growing appreciation of the importance of the subject. While physiographic processes and resulting land forms occupy a large place in geographical control, the earth in its simple mathematical aspects should be better understood than it generally is, and mathematical geography deserves a larger place in the literature of the subject than the few pages generally given to it in our physical geographies and elementary astronomies. It is generally conceded that the mathematical portion of geography is the most di_cult, the most poorly taught and least understood, and that students require the most help in understanding it. The subject-matter of mathematical geography is scattered about in many works, and no one book treats the subject with any degree of thoroughness, or even makes a pretense at doing so. It is with the view of meeting the need for such a volume that this work has been undertaken. Although designed for use in secondary schools and for teachers' preparation, much material herein organized may be used in the upper grades of the elementary school. The subject has not been presented from the point of view of a little child, but an attempt has been made to keep its scope within the attainments of a student in a normal school, academy, or high school. If a very short course in mathematical geography is given, or if students are relatively advanced, much of the subject-matter may be omitted or given as special reports. To the student or teacher who seconds some portions too difficult, it is suggested that the discussions which seem obscure at first reading are often made clear by additional explanation given farther on in the book. Usually the second study of a topic which seems too difficult should be deferred until the entire chapter has been read over carefully. The experimental work which is suggested is given for the purpose of making the principles studied concrete and vivid. The measure of the educational value of a laboratory exercise in a school of secondary grade is not found in the academic results obtained, but in the attainment of a conception of a process. The student's determination of latitude, for example, may not be of much value if its worth is estimated in terms of facts obtained, but the forming of the conception of the process is a result of inestimable educational value. Much time may be wasted, however, if the student is required to rediscover the facts and laws of nature which are often so simple that to see is to accept and understand. Acknowledgments are due to many eminent scholars for suggestions, verification of data, and other valuable assistance in the preparation of this book.",0.00,5:0|4:0|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:0,0,0,,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1484910494,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28436357-mathematical-geography

31361,7786767,The Deaves Affair,Hulbert Footner,"William Hulbert Footner (1879-1944) was a Canadian writer of non-fiction and detective fiction. His first published works were travelogues of canoe trips on the Hudson River and in the Northwest Territory along the Peace River, Hay River and Fraser River. He also wrote a series of northwest adventures during the period 1911 through 1920, including The Sealed Valley (1914) and The Fur Bringers (1920). About 1920 Footner began to write detective fiction. His first series detective character was Madame Rosika Storey. Footner's other series detective is Amos Lee Mappin, a successful, middle aged mystery writer whose crimes tend to occur in New York's cafe society. Mappin is unusual in that his ""Watson"" (at least in some of his tales) is a young woman, his secretary Fanny Parran. She is one of the few female ""Watsons"" in fiction, an example of how female-oriented Footner's fiction is. Amongst his other works are: Two on the Trail (1911), New Rivers of the North (1912), Jack Chanty (1913), The Huntress (1917), Thieve's Wit (1918), The Substitute Millionaire (1919), The Fur Bringers: A Story of the Canadian Northwest (1920) and The Owl Taxi (1921).",3.38,5:1|4:2|3:4|2:1|1:0|total:8,6,2,,,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1355108692l/7786767._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1355108692l/7786767._SX50_.jpg,1104258684,9781104258689,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7786767-the-deaves-affair

It has now been expanded and supplied with a full equipment of documents - Protocols of Congresses and Conferences, Treaty Stipulations, Diplomatic Correspondence and other public Acts in the hope that it may prove useful as a permanent record and serviceable to those of our communal organisations whose duty it will be to bring the still unsolved aspects of the Jewish Question before the coming Peace Conference.<br /><br />Besides helping to indicate the lines on which Jewish action should travel in this matter, the State Papers here quoted may also serve to remind the Plenipotentiaries themselves that the Jewish Question is far from being a subsidiary issue in the Reconstruction of Europe, that they have a great tradition of effort and achievement in regard to it, and that this tradition.<br /><br />About the Publisher<br /><br />Forgotten Books publishes hundreds of thousands of rare and classic books.

31406,2349154,Cudjo's Cave,John Townsend Trowbridge,"<i>Cudjo’s Cave</i> chronicles the brutalities and fears faced by unionists, loyal to Abraham Lincoln and the federal cause, living in secessionist states politically aligned with the Confederacy. Set in 1861 in a fictionalized rural village in east Tennessee, the story revolves around four main characters who find themselves trapped together with other unionists in “Cudjo’s Cave.”<br /><br />Penn Hapgood is a Quaker schoolmaster who openly voices his antislavery sentiments and support for the Union but refuses to fight even when faced with the probability of being shot for his stance. Virginia Villars, a clergyman’s daughter who loves Hapgood, is hotly pursued by the sinister planter and slave master Augustus Blythewood. Pomp, an intelligent man trained as a doctor, is a runaway slave, and Cudjo, another runaway who has been dehumanized by slavery’s violence, still risks all to save others. John Townsend Trowbridge’s fine literary skill and storytelling ability lift the Victorian plot. He artfully maps out many of the cultural and political tensions regarding the issues of slavery and secession, giving the reader access to the popular sentiments of the period. More important, he offers a rare 19th-century depiction of a character of full African descent as a strong, intelligent leader. Released to popular acclaim in the summer of 1863, this novel was designed to awaken patriotism in northern citizens wearied by the losses of conflict and to refocus attention on the moral purposes of the war—emancipation of the slaves. Like <i>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</i>, this stimulating story contributed vital power to the success of the Union war effort.",4.00,5:2|4:4|3:2|2:0|1:0|total:8,5,0,552,University Alabama Press,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,0817310894,9780817310899,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2349154.Cudjo_s_Cave

Purchasers can download a free scanned copy of the original book (without typos) from the publisher. Not indexed. Not illustrated. 1906 edition. Excerpt: ...nine Bachelors were required to testify to fitness; in the case of the M.A., nine Masters had to swear this from 'sure knowledge', and five more 'to the best of their belief (de credulitate). These depositions were whispered into the ears of the Proctor by the witnesses kneeling before him. The information was given on oath, and as it were under the seal of confession; for neither they nor the Proctors were allowed to reveal it. Of all this picturesque ceremony nothing is left but the number' nine'; so many M. A.s at least must be present, in order that the degree may be rightly given. It is not infrequent, towards the close of a degree ceremony, for a Dean who is about to leave, having presented his own men, to be asked to remain until the proceedings are over, in order to 'make a House The preliminaries, formal or otherwise, to the conferment of degrees have now been described. Two other points must be here mentioned, in one of which the University still retains its old custom, in the other it has departed from it. Decrees in The first is the requirement which has quiredfor always been maintained in Oxford, that theHigher a candidate for one of the higher degrees, Faculties, e.g. the D.D. or the D.M., should have first passed through the Arts course, and taken the ordinary B.A. degree. This principle, that a general education should precede a special study, is most important now; it has also a venerable history. It was established by the University as long ago as the beginningof the fourteenth century, and was the result of a long struggle against the Mendicant Friars. This struggle was part of that jealousy between the Regular and the Secular Clergy, which is so important in the history of the English Church in mediaeval times.

Golah had the wisdom to wield it with effect; for by it, with the assistance of two striplings, he easily controlled those who, under other circumstances, would have claimed the right to be free. Chapter Forty Six. An unjust Reward. The next morning on resuming the journey Golah condescended to tell his captives that they should reach a well or spring that afternoon, and stay by it for two or three days. This news was conveyed to Harry by the Krooman; and all were elated at the prospect of rest, with a plentiful supply of water. Harry had a long conversation with the Krooman as they were pursuing their route. The latter expressed his surprise that the white captives were so contented to go on in the course in which the sheik was conducting them. This was a subject about which Harry and his companions had given themselves no concern; partly because they had no idea that Golah was intending to make a very long journey, and partly because they supposed his intentions, whatever they were, could not be changed by anything they might propose. The Krooman thought different. He told Harry that the route they were following, if continued, would lead them far into the interior of the country, probably to Timbuctoo; and that Golah should be entreated to take them to some port on the coast, where they might be ransomed by an English consul. Harry perceived the truth of these suggestions; and, after having a conversation with his companions, it was determined between them that they should have a talk with Golah that very night. The Krooman promised to act as interpreter, and to do all in his power to favour their suit. He might persuade the sheik to change his destination, by telling him that he would find a far better market in taking them to some place where vessels arrive and depart, than by carrying them into the interior of the country.

She was to have everything ready, and the table laid for tea. To-morrow they would all be sitting there, round the table. To-morrow she would see Robert's children, and hold them in her arms. Her heart gave a sudden leap, as if something had quickened in it. Her brain glowed. Her pulses throbbed with the race of the glad blood in her veins. Her whole being moved, trembling and yearning, toward an incredible joy. Till that moment she had hardly realised Robert's children. A strange unquietness, not yet recognised as fear, had kept her from asking him many questions about them. Even now, their forms were like the forms of children seen in the twilight of dreams, the dreams of women who have never had children; forms that hover and torture and pursue; that hide their faces, half seen; that will not come to the call, nor be held by the hand, nor gathered to the heart. 158 That she should really see them, and hear their voices, and hold them in her arms, to-morrow, seemed to her a thing impossible, beyond credibility or dream. Then she said to herself that it all depended on what happened between to-morrow and to-day. It was not long past seven and she had still a good twenty minutes before her. She spent it in pacing up and down the room, and looking at the clock every time she turned and confronted it. At the half-hour she arranged herself on the sofa, with a book, in an attitude of carelessness as to the event. As a material appearance the attitude was perfect. She rose as the servant announced ""Mr. Wilfrid Marston."" She stood as she had risen, waiting for her visitor to advance. Her eyes were fixed on her book which she laid down, deliberately marking the page, and yet she was aware of his little pause at the door as it closed behind him, and of 159 his little smile that took her in. She had no need to look at him. He was a man of middle size, who held himself so well that...",4.00,5:0|4:3|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:3,3,1,50,Rarebooksclub.com,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1381287709l/9824257._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1381287709l/9824257._SX50_.jpg,1153644665,9781153644662,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9824257-the-immortal-moment

31431,2165,The Old Man and the Sea,Ernest Hemingway,"The last novel Ernest Hemingway saw published, The Old Man and the Sea has proved itself to be one of the enduring works of American fiction. It is the story of an old Cuban fisherman and his supreme ordeal: a relentless, agonizing battle with a giant marlin far out in the Gulf Stream. Using the simple, powerful language of a fable, Hemingway takes the timeless themes of courage in the face of defeat and personal triumph won from loss and transforms them into a magnificent twentieth-century classic.",3.76,5:226197|4:239085|3:169708|2:63809|1:34431|total:733230,652568,15268,132,Scribner,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1329189714l/2165._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1329189714l/2165._SY75_.jpg,0684830493,9780684830490,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2165.The_Old_Man_and_the_Sea

Hoffmann,"Excerpt from Weird Tales, Vol. 2 of 2<br /><br />One day there arose before this picture a fruitless altercation as to whether the artist really intended it for anything more than a mere picture, that is, the temporary situation, sufficiently indicated by the verse, of a decrepit old man who with all his splendour and magnificence is unable to satisfy the desires of a heart filled with yearning aspirations, or whether he intended to represent an actual historical event. One after the other the visitors left the place, tired of the discussion, so that at length there were only two men left, both very good friends to the noble art of painting. I can't understand, said one of them, how people can spoil all their enjoyment by eternally hunting after some jejune interpretation or explanation. Indepen dently of the fact that I have a pretty accurate notion of what the relations in life between this Doge and Dogess were, I am more particularly struck by the sub dued richness and power that characterises the picture as a whole.

The bulk of his work, having a Boy Scouting theme, revolves around the fictional town of Bridgeboro, New Jersey. Characters included Tom Slade, Pee-wee Harris, Roy Blakely, and Westy Martin. Fitzhugh's Scouting based books were very popular with children and adults. His characters became so real to his readers that it was not uncommon for Percy to receive fan mail addressed to the characters themselves. In the 1930's, as the popularity of Fitzhugh's Scouting stories began to wane, he began writing the Hal Keen Mystery Series (10 titles) under the pseudonym Hugh Lloyd. They were followed by another mystery series - Skippy Dare - (3 titles).

31462,112510,The Vicar of Wakefield,Oliver Goldsmith,"Oliver Goldsmith's hugely successful novel of 1766 remained for generations one of the most highly regarded and beloved works of eighteenth-century fiction. It depicts the fall and rise of the Primrose family, presided over by the benevolent vicar, the narrator of a fairy-tale plot of impersonation and deception, the abduction of a beautiful heroine and the machinations of an aristocratic villain. By turns comic and sentimental, the novel's popularity owes much to its recognizable depiction of domestic life and loving family relationships.<br /><br />New to this edition is an introduction by Robert L.

Cuenta la historia de una mujer de la burguesía española con buenas relaciones sociales -el marido forma parte de la burocracia de Palacio- pero con problemas económicos. Esta situación la lleva a endeudarse y al adulterio. Una vez más, Galdós narra los problemas de la clase media madrileña y todas las implicaciones que supone el desfase entre su realidad y sus deseos de ascenso social. Su protagonista, la de Bringas, es un personaje inolvidable: frente al marido pusilánime, ella carga con el peso familiar y mueve los hilos sociales para no perder su posición. Necesita comprar ropa para ella y su hija, necesita mantener una buena apariencia y por eso recurre al crédito.",3.56,5:40|4:86|3:69|2:23|1:8|total:226,182,14,312,Cátedra,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,8437604257,9788437604251,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1777644.La_de_Bringas

The religion of politics is nothing else than the application of religious principles to politi cal action, whether it be the action of a statesman or a private citizen, of an individual or of the com munity. The politician should respect these princi ples as much as any other man. Political opinion, political discussion, political life should be brought under the inﬂuence of religious convictions.

31504,30510859,Plato: The Republic: A Dialogue Concerning Justice,Plato,"The present edition of Plato's ""Republic"" is a reproduction of the translation completed by Thomas Taylor. Stephanus numbers have been added to the original text for easy reference. Also included are Taylor's introduction, copious notes, and an Apology for the Fables of Homer by Proclus, introducing the 2nd and 3rd Books of the Republic. This is the third book in a series of publications reproducing the Works of Plato. The first volume in this series reproduced Taylor's ""General Introduction to the Philosophy and Writings of Plato"" (ISBN: 9781530752379) and the second reproduced Taylor's translation of the ""First Alcibiades"" (ISBN: 9781530843312) From the Foreword: The topic of discussion, throughout all ten books of the Republic, is Justice-justice in the polity of the city-state, and justice as a virtue of our soul. The key feature of this dialogue, the thread that binds it together from beginning to end, is the correspondence between these two. ""The design of Plato, says Proclus, in this dialogue, is both concerning a polity and true justice, not as two distinct things, but as the same with each other. For what justice is in one soul, that such a polity as is delineated by Plato is in a well inhabited city."" (Taylor) The Republic opens with an exploration of what is best or most beneficial for man: to be just or to be unjust. While on the surface this may seem, morally at least, to be a simple question with a simple answer, strong arguments are made for the benefits of acting unjustly, especially if one is able to simultaneously act unjustly and gain the reputation of a just man: for in such a case, one will procure all that can be gained from unjust actions (increased wealth, position, power, etc.) while facing none or very few of the common disadvantages of being unjust (punishments, low public opinion, etc.). It is argued, one might say quite fairly based on common experience, that justice is rarely pursued for the sake of justice itself, but rather for the perceived benefit to the individual, i.e. the common man only seeks justice if they find there to be some personal advantage in doing so. Socrates addresses these fundamental questions and the several arguments levelled against justice in the opening book of the Republic, and demonstrates, with clear and detailed reasonings, several of the glaring deficiencies in these arguments. The question of whether justice is truly better than injustice is not left to such initial reasonings, however, as Socrates's companions urge him into the greater depths of the subject. This naturally opens the dialogue to a fuller exploration of the nature of justice: what it is, what relation is has to our soul, to our city, and so on. The dialogue thus treads through much territory, centering initially around an ideal construction of a just city, while using the knowledge gained through its analysis to shed light on the role of justice in each individual. It passes on to a definition and unveiling of the nature of a true philosopher, and their proper role in such a just city, and from there to an exploration of the forms of polity and their correspondence with types of men (i.e. Timocratic, Oligarchic, Democratic, Tyrannic), relating the conditions and attitudes of each polity to the same conditions and attitudes within the corresponding man. Book 9 provides what may be viewed as a conclusion on what is better: justice or injustice, covering three major points of argument. The close of the dialogue (Book 10) presents us with something a little different: a view of the immortality of the soul and a vision of death and rebirth, complete with postmortem judgment and necessity, corresponding with the common ""eastern"" notions of karma and reincarnation. Here we see justice and injustice dealt with in direct relation to the immortal soul, beyond the realm of worldly utilitarianism.",3.93,5:52083|4:50892|3:34220|2:8746|1:3462|total:149403,1,0,440,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1465680992l/30510859._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1465680992l/30510859._SX50_.jpg,1533351619,9781533351616,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30510859-plato

Born on a Celtic isle to eight warrior-witch mothers, Maeve is raised to be as brave as any hero.

When she wins her freedom and finds her lost lover, a stormy life begins for both as we follow the Passion story through the eyes of Jesus's partner.

Subjects: Witchcraft History / Medieval Body, Mind<br /><br />It has been said by a thoughtful writer that the subject of witchcraft has hardly received that place which it deserves in the history of opinions. There has been, of course, a reason for this neglect-the fact that the belief in witchcraft is no longer existent among intelligent people and that its history, in consequence, seems to possess rather an antiquarian than a living interest. No one can tell the story of the witch trials of sixteenth and seventeenth century England without digging up a buried past, and the process of exhumation is not always pleasant. Yet the study of English witchcraft is more than an unsightly exposure of a forgotten superstition. There were few aspects of sixteenth and seventeenth century life that were not affected by the ugly belief. It is quite impossible to grasp the social conditions, it is impossible to understand the opinions, fears, and hopes of the men and women who lived in Elizabethan and Stuart England, without some knowledge of the part played in that age by witchcraft.",3.58,5:37|4:46|3:48|2:12|1:10|total:153,135,2,,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11815045-a-history-of-witchcraft-in-england-from-1558-to-1718

Pip has lost his parents very early in life and is being brought up by his much older sister and brother-in-law Joe Gargery. His sister is a dominating and shrewish woman, while Joe is an affectionate man. Joe's uncle Mr Pumblechook (another of Dickens' delightfully evocative names) asks Joe to send Pip to the stately mansion Statis House ostensibly to play with the owner Miss Havisham's adopted daughter Estella. This marks the beginning of a life-changing experience for Pip. <br /> <br />Miss Havisham is a wealthy eccentric whose twisted agenda is that of taking revenge on the man who jilted her at the altar. Pip is unwittingly drawn into her malevolent schemes. When Pip grows older, Miss Havisham's lawyer Mr Jaggers informs Pip that he has come into a large fortune from an unknown benefactor and that he must move to London and learn to become a “gentleman.” What follows is a strange and labyrinthine tale of Pip's journey into adulthood. <br /> <br />Dickens' wonderful gift for characterization peoples the book with a host of memorable characters and sub-plots. The novel also explores the fears and anxieties of childhood and traces Pip's moral and emotional development and his ambitions as he matures. Estella as the warped creation of a vengeful mind has her own route to traverse. <br /> <br />Great Expectations finds Charles Dickens at the peak of his creative powers. The Victorian preoccupation with wealth and social ambition, personal ambition, class distinctions, crime and punishment and how they looked at education and self improvement as a means to rise in society are all vividly portrayed here. There are some delightfully humorous passages throughout the book which add to its flavor and authenticity. As with most of Dickens' work, this is a book to be savored by young and old alike and preferably to be read aloud, as Dickens himself did in his wildly popular public readings.",3.77,5:181889|4:201178|3:139138|2:51005|1:26623|total:599833,0,0,,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44396829-great-expectations-illustrated

With his cover blown, he is waiting for the next move in the cat-and-mouse game that, even a decade after Germany’s defeat, continues to shadow his life.</b><br /> <br /> The French Riviera, 1956: The invitation to dinner was not unexpected, though neither was it welcome. Ernst Mielke, deputy head of the East German Stasi, has turned up in Nice, and he’s not on holiday. An old and dangerous adversary, Mielke is calling in a debt. He intends that Bernie go to London and, with the vial of Thallium he now pushes across the table, poison a female agent they both have had dealings with. <br /><br /> But chance intervenes in the form of Friedrich Korsch, an old Kripo comrade now working for Stasi and probably there to make sure Bernie gets the job done. Bernie bolts for the German border. Traveling by night, holed up during the day, Bernie has plenty of down time to recall the last time Korsch and he worked together.<br /><br /> It was the summer of 1939: At Hitler’s mountaintop retreat in Obersalzberg, the body of a low-level bureaucrat has been found murdered. Bernie and Korsch are selected to run the case. They have one week to solve the murder—Hitler is due back then to celebrate his fiftieth birthday. Lucky Bernie: it’s his reward for being Kripo’s best homicide detective. He knows what a box he’s in: millions have been spent to secure Obersalzberg. It would be a disaster if Hitler were to discover a shocking murder had been committed on the terrace of his own home. But the mountaintop is home to an elite Nazi community. It would be an even bigger disaster for Bernie if one of them was the murderer.<br /><br />1939 and 1956: two different eras, seventeen years apart. And yet, not really apart, as the stunning climax will show when the two converge explosively.",4.27,5:1774|4:1605|3:469|2:82|1:25|total:3955,1638,252,,Marian Wood Books/Putnam,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1481047676l/30056163._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1481047676l/30056163._SY75_.jpg,069841313X,9780698413139,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30056163-prussian-blue

Max is an inspirational figure, but he is also a flawed idealist whose vow to protect the Javanese from cruelty ends in his own downfall. In Max Havelaar, Multatuli (the pseudonym for Eduard Douwes Dekker) vividly recreated his own experiences in Java and tellingly depicts the hypocrisy of those who gained from the corrupt coffee trade. Sending shockwaves through the Dutch nation when it was published in 1860, this damning exposé of the terrible conditions in the colonies led to welfare reforms in Java and continues to inspire the fairtrade movement today.<br /><br />Roy Edwards's vibrant translation conveys the satirical and innovative style of Multatuli's autobiographical polemic.

It is a poem of the love of country, to which all people belong.<br /><br />Pan Tadeusz, the full title in English: Mister Thaddeus, or the Last Foray in Lithuania: a History of the Nobility in the Years 1811 and 1812 in Twelve Books of Verse (Polish: Pan Tadeusz, czyli ostatni zajazd na Litwie. Historia szlachecka z roku 1811 i 1812 we dwunastu księgach wierszem pisana) is an epic poem by the Polish poet, writer and philosopher Adam Mickiewicz. The book was first published in June 1834 in Paris, and is considered by many to be the last great epic poem in European literature[citation needed].<br /><br />Pan Tadeusz is recognized as the national epic of Poland. It is compulsory reading in Polish schools. A film based on the poem was made in 1999 by Andrzej Wajda.<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Content<br /><br />The story takes place over the course of five days in 1811 and one day in 1812 at a point in Polish history, when Poland-Lithuania had already been divided between Russia, Prussia, and Austria (see Partitions of Poland) and disappeared from the political map of Europe, although Napoleon had established the Duchy of Warsaw in the Prussian partition in 1807.<br /><br />The place is situated within the Russian partition, in the Lithuanian village of Soplicowo. Pan Tadeusz recounts the story of two feuding noble families, and the love between Tadeusz Soplica (the title character) of one family, and Zosia of the other. Another subplot involves a spontaneous revolt of the local inhabitants against the occupying Russian garrison. Since Mickiewicz published his poem as an exile in Paris, he was free of the Russian censors.",3.35,5:1255|4:1677|3:1818|2:1025|1:486|total:6261,0,0,,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,3655300816,9783655300817,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12725400-pan-tadeusz-czyli-ostatni-zajazd-na-litwie-historja-szlachecka-z-r-181

Durante este año Europa entera se rebela contra el invasor, y los ejércitos de rusos, prusianos, austríacos, bávaros, sajones y de otros pueblos sometidos a Francia persiguen a los restos del ejército francés que se retira y amenazan el solar galo.<br /><br />Emile Erckmann (1822-1899) y Alexandre Chatrian (1826-1890), escritores alsacianos, aunaron sus nombres bajo el seudónimo de Erckmann-Chatrian para publicar una serie de cuadros históricos ambientados en las guerras napoleónicas -como hicieran Tolstoy, Stendhal, y otros maestros que escogieron esta gran contienda como telón de fondo para sus mejores tramas-, serie iniciada en 1862 con el presente volumen, <i>La invasión, o el loco Yégof</i>, al que seguirían <i>Madame Therese o los voluntarios de 1792</i> (1863), <i>Historia de un recluta de 1813</i> (1864), <i>Waterloo</i> (1865), y otras.<br /><br /><i>La invasión, o el loco Yégof</i> muestra la retirada del ejército derrotado de Napoleón vista desde el sufrido país fronterizo de Alsacia (que en la historia reciente ha pertenecido tanto a Alemania como a Francia), en tono escéptico y antimilitarista. La Alsacia siempre fue un país misterioso, y los Vosgos, escarpados y selváticos, son cuna de leyendas y mitos. Un viejo loco, estrafalario y terrible, Yégof, recorre la comarca de la Serranía coronado de hojalata y perorando sobre castillos, duques, vasallos, jefes, posesiones y combates. Recuerda las terribles batallas que allí tuvieron lugar mil setecientos años atrás y proclama que ha llegado el tiempo de la venganza: los del norte, los suyos, vuelven. Siguiendo ancestrales costumbres, más tarde renovadas, la Alsacia se atrinchera ante otro avatar de invasión.",2.00,5:0|4:0|3:1|2:0|1:1|total:2,1,0,224,Valdemar,spa,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1420406917l/24294714._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1420406917l/24294714._SY75_.jpg,8477023603,9788477023609,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24294714-la-invasi-n-o-el-loco-y-gof

By war's end she had lost virtually everyone she loved. <i>Testament of Youth</i> is both a record of what she lived through and an elegy for a vanished generation.

Men of adventure who took to pirating in classical times around the Mediterranean are featured in these stirring true tales of high-seas treachery. Gripping narratives of corsairs, freebooters, and privateers—from the Vikings in their longships to the pirates of the Levant and the China Seas—come vividly to life in these swashbuckling, compulsively readable chronicles. Here are riveting accounts of North Sea brigands, Elizabethan seamen, and Turkish pirates; of notorious plunderers like Henry Morgan, Edward (Blackbeard) Teach, and Captain Kidd; as well as the pirates of Borneo and China.<br />Enhanced with sixteen illustrations, the fascinating text recounts as well the stories of daring men who intercepted enemy ships for King and country (and to enrich their own purses). Sure to be welcomed by armchair sailors, this highly readable study of the maritime marauders who sailed under the Black Flag will also appeal to naval historians and old salts.",3.18,5:1|4:3|3:5|2:1|1:1|total:11,10,1,352,Dover Publications,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328863718l/5072843._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328863718l/5072843._SY75_.jpg,0486448606,9780486448602,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5072843-pirates-and-piracy

31557,33214236,The Works of Robert Louis Stevenson - Swanston Edition Vol. 20,Robert Louis Stevenson,"Excerpt ure you, quite an oddity."" The oddity, you may be certain, ground his teeth. She had a way of standing in our midst, nodding around, and addressing us in what she imagined to be French: ""Bienne, hommes! ca va bienne?"" I took the freedom to reply in the same lingo: ""Bienne, femme! ca va couci-couci tout d'meme, la bourgeoise!"" And at that, when we had all laughed, with a little more heartiness than was entirely civil, ""I told you he was quite an oddity!"" says she in triumph. Needless to say, these passages were before I had remarked the niece. The aunt came on the day in question with a following rather more than usually large, which she manoeuvred to and fro about the market and lectured to at rather more than usual length, and with rather less than her accustomed tact. I kept my eyes down, but they were ever fixed in the same direction, quite in vain. The aunt came and went, and pulled us out, and showed us off, like caged monkeys; but the niece kept herself on th""",3.66,5:29|4:35|3:45|2:13|1:0|total:122,0,0,396,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,eng,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1540578739,9781540578730,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33214236-the-works-of-robert-louis-stevenson---swanston-edition-vol-20

31567,8774438,The Lawyers: A Drama in Five Acts,Augustus William Iffland,"Augustus Wilhelm Iffland (1759-1814) was a German actor and dramatic author. His father intended him to be a clergyman, but Iffland preferred the stage, and at eighteen ran away to Gotha in order to prepare himself for a theatrical career. He was fortunate enough to receive instruction from Hans Ekhof, and made such rapid progress that he was able to accept an engagement at the theatre in Mannheim in 1779, beginning his rise into prominence. He soon stood high in his profession, and enhanced his reputation by frequently playing in other towns. Iffland produced the classical works of Goethe and Schiller with conscientious care, but he had little understanding for the drama of the romantic writers. His best-known plays are Die Jager, Dienstpflicht, Die Advokaten, Die Mundel and Die Hagstolzen. Iffland was also a dramatic critic, and German actors placed high value on his reasonings and hints about their works in his Almanach fur Theater und Theaterfreunde. During 1798-1802 he issued his Dramatischen Werke in sixteen volumes, to which he added an autobiography (Meine Theatralische Laufbahn). During 1807-1809 Iffland put out two volumes of Neue Dramatische Werke.",0.00,5:0|4:0|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:0,0,0,112,Dodo Press,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1409994120,9781409994121,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8774438-the-lawyers

They are found in traditions across the world, east and west, old and new. They were the guiding force of the occult revival at the turn of the 20th century, and continue to aid us today. Often overlooked in the traditions of the Witch, yet ever present in the form of the Mighty Dead, first written about publicly in the works of Gerald Gardner. These are the elder spirits who gather by the edges of our circle to witness our magick, and if asked, can enter into relationship with us. They are the true teachers of the mysteries, and the true initiators. The Mighty Dead help us regenerate our own lost traditions, awakening our spiritual roots to deeper truths. By forging connections with them, collectively or individually, we too can learn how to evolve and pass through the cycles of reincarnation to become one with these sanctified masters.

Brock (1898)<br />- 20 black and white drawings by Hugh Thomson (1897)<br /><br />Jane Austen’s first novel, Northanger Abbey—published posthumously in 1818—tells the story of Catherine Morland and her dangerously sweet nature, innocence, and sometime self-delusion. Though Austen’s fallible heroine is repeatedly drawn into scrapes while vacationing at Bath and during her subsequent visit to Northanger Abbey, Catherine eventually triumphs, blossoming into a discerning woman who learns truths about love, life, and the heady power of literature. The satirical Northanger Abbey pokes fun at the gothic novel while earnestly emphasizing caution to the female sex.",3.81,5:76437|4:100377|3:75473|2:18390|1:5167|total:275844,5,1,,,eng,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21838309-northanger-abbey
31587,18077875,Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less,Greg McKeown,"Have you ever found yourself stretched too thin?<br /> <br />Do you simultaneously feel overworked and underutilized?<br /> <br />Are you often busy but not productive?<br /> <br />Do you feel like your time is constantly being hijacked by other people’s agendas?<br /> <br />If you answered yes to any of these, the way out is the <i>Way of the Essentialist</i><b>.</b><br /> <br />The Way of the Essentialist isn’t about getting more done in less time. It’s about getting <i>only the right things</i> done.  It is not  a time management strategy, or a productivity technique. It is a <i>systematic discipline</i> for discerning what is absolutely essential, then eliminating everything that is not, so we can make the highest possible contribution towards the things that really matter.  <br /><br />By forcing us to apply a more selective criteria for what is Essential, the disciplined pursuit of less empowers us to reclaim control of our own choices about where to spend our precious time and energy – instead of giving others the implicit permission to choose for us.<br /><br />Essentialism is not one more thing – it’s a whole new way of doing everything. A must-read for any leader, manager, or individual who wants to learn who to do less, but better, in every area of their lives, Essentialism  is a movement whose time has come.",4.03,5:14992|4:14175|3:7571|2:2127|1:598|total:39463,33356,3453,260,Crown Business,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1403165375l/18077875._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1403165375l/18077875._SY75_.jpg,0804137382,9780804137386,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18077875-essentialism

But for Victoria Jones, it's been more useful in communicating grief, mistrust, and solitude. After a childhood spent in the foster-care system, she is unable to get close to anybody, and her only connection to the world is through flowers and their meanings.<br /><br />Now eighteen and emancipated from the system, Victoria has nowhere to go and sleeps in a public park, where she plants a small garden of her own. Soon a local florist discovers her talents, and Victoria realizes she has a gift for helping others through the flowers she chooses for them. But a mysterious vendor at the flower market has her questioning what's been missing in her life, and when she's forced to confront a painful secret from her past, she must decide whether it's worth risking everything for a second chance at happiness.",4.08,5:65131|4:79454|3:32653|2:6346|1:1770|total:185354,159688,16420,323,Ballantine Books,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1333577674l/10032672._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1333577674l/10032672._SX50_.jpg,034552554X,9780345525543,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10032672-the-language-of-flowers

In his highly-acclaimed book of the same title, he shares the deeply personal meditation that led him to discover the place within which God has chosen to dwell. This Lent course, which has been adapted from the book, helps us to reflect on the meaning of the parable for our own lives. Divided into five sessions, the course moves through the parable exploring our reaction to the story: the younger son's leaving and return, the father's restoration of sonship, the elder son's resentment and the father's compassion. All of us who have experienced loneliness, dejection, jealousy or anger will respond to the persistent themes of homecoming, affirmation and reconciliation.",4.37,5:8718|4:4261|3:1654|2:406|1:214|total:15253,13342,694,160,"Darton, Longman and Todd",eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327010857l/175113._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327010857l/175113._SX50_.jpg,023252078X,9780232520781,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/175113.The_Return_of_the_Prodigal_Son

31616,19264405,Health Lessons Book 1,Alvin Davison,"This ebook is complete with illustrations, linked Index and linked Table of Content making navigation quicker and easier.<br /><br />Scarcely one half of the children of our country continue in school much beyond the fifth grade. It is important, therefore, that so far as possible the knowledge which has most to do with human welfare should be presented in the early years of school life.<br /><br />Fisher, Metchnikoff, Sedgwick, and others have shown that the health of a people influences the prosperity and happiness of a nation more than any other one thing. The highest patriotism is therefore the conservation of health. The seven hundred thousand lives annually destroyed by infectious diseases and the million other serious cases of sickness from contagious maladies, with all their attendant suffering, are largely sacrifices on the altar of ignorance. The loving mother menaces the life of her babe by feeding it milk with a germ content nearly half as great as that of sewage, the anemic girl sleeps with fast-closed windows, wondering in the morning why she feels so lifeless, and the one-time vigorous boy goes to a consumptive's early grave, because they did not know (what every school ought to teach) the way to health.<br /><br />Doctor Price, the Secretary of the State Board of Health of Maryland, recently said before the American Public Health Association that the text-books of our schools show a marked disregard for the urgent problems which enter our daily life, such as the prevention of tuberculosis, typhoid fever, and acute infectious diseases.<br /><br />Since the observing public have seen educated communities decrease their death rate from typhoid fever, tuberculosis, and diphtheria from one third to three fourths by heeding the health call, lawmakers are becoming convinced that the needless waste of human life should be stopped. Michigan has already decreed that every school child shall be taught the cause and prevention of the communicable diseases, and several other states are contemplating like action. This book meets fully the demands of all such laws as are contemplated, and presents the important truths not by dogmatic assertion, but by citing specific facts appealing to the child mind in such a way as to make a lasting impression.<br /><br />After the eleventh year of age, the first cause of death among school children is tuberculosis. The chief aim of the author has been to show the child the sure way of preventing this disease and others of like nature, and to establish an undying faith in the motto of Pasteur, ""It is within the power of man to rid himself of every parasitic disease.""<br /><br />Nearly all of the illustrations used are from photographs and drawings specially prepared for this book. These, together with the large amount of material gleaned from original sources and from the author's experiments in the laboratory, will, it is hoped, make this little volume worthy of the same generous welcome accorded the two earlier books of this series.",2.00,5:0|4:0|3:1|2:0|1:1|total:2,2,0,,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19264405-health-lessons-book-1

31637,1352987,"Harry Potter et la Coupe de Feu (Harry Potter, #4)",J.K. Rowling,"Dans ce quatrième tome, Harry et la Coupe de feu, le plus populaire des apprentis sorciers fait sa rentrée pour une quatrième année trépidante au collège de sorcellerie. Une fois de plus, J. K. Rowling nous effraye autant qu'elle nous ravit avec sa pléiade de dragons, d'elfes et de combats contre la mort.<br /><br />Il ne reste à son héros orphelin âgé aujourd'hui de 14 ans que deux semaines à passer dans sa famille de moldus avant de retourner au collège de sorcellerie Poudlard. Mais une nuit, une vision suffisamment obsédante pour réveiller sa cicatrice en forme d'éclair met les nerfs de Harry à vif et le pousse à contacter son parrain en sorcellerie, Sirius Black. Heureusement, la perspective d'assister au grand événement sportif de la saison, la Coupe du monde de Quidditch, suffit à faire oublier pour quelque temps à Harry que Lord Voldemort et ses sinistres comparses, les mangeurs de Mort, sont en route pour tuer.<br /><br />Lecteurs, nous allons maintenant recouvrir le reste de l'intrigue d'une immense cape d'invisibilité et nous nous bornerons à vous révéler que Qui-Vous-Savez est à la poursuite de Harry, et que cette année, il n'y aura pas de matchs de Quidditch entre Gryffondor, Serdaigle, Poufsouffle et Serpentard. Cette fois c'est Poudlard qui disputera un tournoi de sorcellerie contre deux autres écoles de magiciens, les Élégants de Beauxbaton et les Glaçons de Durmstrang. Les candidats sélectionnés devront passer trois ultimes épreuves. Harry fera-t-il partie des heureux élus ?<br /><br />Quant à vous, fans de Quidditch, ne soyez-pas déçus : nous retrouvons ce grand jeu au moment de la Coupe du monde. 100 000 sorcières et magiciens soucieux d'incognito et tentant de se faire passer pour des moldus se rassemblent sur une ""charmante lande déserte"". Rowling nous enchante comme toujours avec ce souci des détails qui rend son univers si vivant et si drôle. Les tentes où s'abritent des spectateurs, par exemple, sortent vraiment de l'ordinaire. L'une d'elles est un palais miniature rempli de vrais paons ; une autre est composée de trois étages surplombés de nombreuses tourelles. Sans parler de tous les accessoires et gadgets proposés au public : des badges qui couinent le nom des joueurs, des modèles réduits de balais Éclairs de feu qui volent vraiment, ainsi que des figurines de joueurs célèbres à collectionner, qui déambulent dans la paume de la main en se pavanant... Il va sans dire que les deux équipes ne se ressemblent pas du tout, et leurs mascottes non plus. La Bulgarie est soutenue par les magnifiques Veela qui enchantent en un instant tous les spectateurs - y compris les supporters d'Irlande - jusqu'à ce que des milliers de petits lutins se lancent dans un spectacle explosif de leur cru en formant une main géante pour adresser un signe vraiment très mal élevé aux Veela, à l'autre bout du terrain...<br /><br />Bien avant la parution du quatrième volume de la série, Rowling avait prévenu qu'il serait plus sombre que le précédent et il est vrai qu'à chaque moment d'hilarité correspond un moment de frayeur où nous craignons pour la vie de Harry, les émotions soulevées par la lecture du livre étant à la mesure des dangers encourus par le héros. Au cours de l'histoire sont évoqués de nouveaux personnages tel Alastor ""Oeil fou"", Moody, un chasseur de sorciers qui pourrait bien sombrer avec l'âge dans une totale paranoïa, ou encore Rita Skeeter qui tourne autour de Poudlard à la recherche d'un article sensationnel.

31640,27595582,Crestlands: A Centennial Story of Cane Ridge,Mary Addams Bayne,"The spirit of Indian Summer, enveloped in a delicate bluish haze, pervaded the Kentucky forest. Through the treetops sounded a sighing minor melody as now and then a leaf bade adieu to the companions of its summer revels, and sought its winter's rest on the ground beneath. On a fallen log a redbird sang with jubilant note. What cared he for the lament of the leaves? True, he must soon depart from this summer home; but only to wing his way to brighter skies, and then return when mating-time should come again. Near a group of hickory-trees a colony of squirrels gathered their winter store of nuts; and a flock of wild turkeys led by a pompous, bearded gobbler picked through the underbrush. At a wayside puddle a deer bent his head to slake his thirst, but scarcely had his lips touched the water when his head was reared again. For an instant he listened, limbs quivering, nostrils dilating, a startled light in his soft eyes; then with a bound he was away into the depths of the forest. The turkeys, heeding the tocsin of alarm from their leader, sought the shelter of the deeper undergrowth; the squirrels dropped their nuts and found refuge in the topmost branches of the tree which they had just pilfered; but the redbird, undisturbed, went on with his caroling, too confident in his own beauty and the charm of his song to fear any intruder.",0.00,5:0|4:0|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:0,0,0,122,Createspace,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1503207420,9781503207424,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27595582-crestlands

31710,13408181,The Hills and the Vale,Richard Jefferies,"Richard Jefferies (1848 1887) remains one of the most thoughtful and most lyrical writers on the English countryside. He had aspirations to make a living as a novelist, but it was his short, factually based articles for The Live Stock Journal and other magazines, drawn from a wealth of knowledge of the rural community into which he had been born, which when collected in book form brought him recognition (though not wealth), and which continued to be read and admired after his early death. The Hills and the Vale, first released in 1909, contains a collection of published and unpublished essays and articles. Written in Jefferies' highly descriptive style, these essays describe rural life and nature in England, illustrating folk traditions and important natural events in rural communities. The sense of wonder evoked by the natural world, which permeates all of Jefferies' works, is fully exemplified in this volume.""",4.33,5:2|4:0|3:1|2:0|1:0|total:3,1,1,350,Cambridge University Press,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1108025315,9781108025317,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13408181-the-hills-and-the-vale

31717,20053031,The Witches of New York,Ami McKay,"The beloved, bestselling author of <i>The Birth House</i> and <i>The Virgin Cure</i> is back with her most beguiling novel yet, luring us deep inside the lives of a trio of remarkable young women navigating the glitz and grotesqueries of Gilded-Age New York by any means possible, including witchcraft... <br /><br />The year is 1880. Two hundred years after the trials in Salem, Adelaide Thom ('Moth' from <i>The Virgin Cure</i>) has left her life in the sideshow to open a tea shop with another young woman who feels it's finally safe enough to describe herself as a witch: a former medical student and ""gardien de sorts"" (keeper of spells), Eleanor St. Clair. Together they cater to Manhattan's high society ladies, specializing in cures, palmistry and potions--and in guarding the secrets of their clients. <br /><br />All is well until one bright September afternoon, when an enchanting young woman named Beatrice Dunn arrives at their door seeking employment. Beatrice soon becomes indispensable as Eleanor's apprentice, but her new life with the witches is marred by strange occurrences. She sees things no one else can see. She hears voices no one else can hear. Objects appear out of thin air, as if gifts from the dead. Has she been touched by magic or is she simply losing her mind? <br /><br />Eleanor wants to tread lightly and respect the magic manifest in the girl, but Adelaide sees a business opportunity. Working with Dr. Quinn Brody, a talented alienist, she submits Beatrice to a series of tests to see if she truly can talk to spirits. Amidst the witches' tug-of-war over what's best for her, Beatrice disappears, leaving them to wonder whether it was by choice or by force. <br /><br />As Adelaide and Eleanor begin the desperate search for Beatrice, they're confronted by accusations and spectres from their own pasts. In a time when women were corseted, confined and committed for merely speaking their minds, were any of them safe?",3.83,5:3090|4:5079|3:3155|2:721|1:177|total:12222,8791,1027,529,,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1483407166l/20053031._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1483407166l/20053031._SX50_.jpg,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20053031-the-witches-of-new-york

We shall discover that it is possible to rescue them from the workhouse and the streets, to enable them to lead useful and happy lives, to provide homes for themselves and those dependent on them, to fulfil all the duties of good citizens......Many of the earliest books, particularly those dating back to 1900's and before, are now extremely scarce and increasingly expensive.

Rudwin,"INTRODUCTION Of all the myths which have come down to us from the East, and of all the creations of Western fancy and belief, the Personality of Evil has had the strongest attraction for the mind of man. The Devil is the greatest enigma that has ever confronted the human intelligence. So large a place has Satan taken in our imagination, and we might also say in our heart, that his expulsion therefrom, no matter what philosophy may teach us, must for ever remain an impossibility. As a character in imaginative literature Lucifer has not his equal in heaven above or on the earth beneath, In contrast to the idea of Good, which is the more exalted in proportion to its freedom from anthropomorphism, the idea of Evil owes to the presence of this element its chief value as a poetic theme. The discrowned arch- angel may have been inferior to St. Michael in military tactics, but he certainly is his superior in matters literary...",3.67,5:0|4:4|3:2|2:0|1:0|total:6,3,1,352,Brown Press,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1443771554,9781443771559,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14374645-devil-stories---an-anthology

Purchasers can download a free scanned copy of the original book (without typos) from the publisher. 1904. Not illustrated. Excerpt: ... CHAPTER I. THE FOUNTAIN OP THE HINDS. A spring of living water, known in the neighborhood by the appropriate name of the ""Fountain of the Hinds,"" empties its trickling stream under the oaks of one of the most secret recesses of the forest of Compiegne. Stags and hinds, deers and does, bucks and she-goats come to water at the spot, leaving behind them numerous imprints of their steps on the borders of the rill, or on the sandy soil of the narrow paths that these wild animals have worn across the copse. One early morning in the year 987, the sun being up barely an hour, a woman, plainly dressed and breathing hard with rapid walking, stepped out of one of these paths and stopped at the Pountain of the Hinds. She looked in all directions in surprise as if she expected to have been preceded by some one at the solitary rendezvous. Pinding her hopes deceived, she made an impatient motion, sat down, still out of breath, on a rock near the fountain, and threw off her cape. The woman, barely twenty years of age, had black hair, eyes and eye-brows; her complexion was brown; and cherry-red her lips. Her features were handsome, while the mobility of her inflated nostrils and the quickness of her motions betoken a violent nature. She had rested only a little while when she rose again and walked up and down with hurried steps, stopping every now and then to listen for approaching footsteps. Catching at last the sounds of a distant footfall, she thrilled with joy and ran to the encounter of him she had been expecting. He appeared. It was a man, also in plain garb and in the vigor of age, largesized and robust, with a piercing eye and somber, wily countenance. The young woman leaped at a bound into the arms of this personage, and passionately addressed him: ""Hugh, I meant to ove...",4.33,5:2|4:4|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:6,3,1,,General Books,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,115146550X,9781151465504,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8458479-the-infant-s-skull-or-the-end-of-the-world-a-tale-of-the-millennium

He does not know the leanness in which his mind is kept by want of the food which he rejects. He does not know what starving of imagination and of thought he has inﬂicted upon himself. He has suffered his interest in the things which make up God's knowable universe to shrink until it reaches no farther than his eyes can see and his ears can hear. The books which he scorns are the telescopes and reﬂectors and reverberators of our intellectual life, holding in themselves a hundred magical powers for the overcoming of space and time, and for giving the range of knowledge which belongs to a really cultivated mind. There is no equal substitute for them. There is nothing else which will so break for us the poor hobble of everyday sights and sounds and habits and tasks, by which our thinking and feeling are naturally tethered to a little worn round.<br /><br />About the Publisher<br /><br />Forgotten Books publishes hundreds of thousands of rare and classic books.

She maintains public safety and order in the park, but her bosses have brought out a hotshot cowboy to help her catch some drug runners who are affecting tourism. She senses the company is holding something back from her, and she's not keen on working with an outsider like Nate Sixkiller.<br /><br />When an imaginary animal from her troubled teenage years reappears, Virgin takes it to mean one of two things: a breakdown (hers!) or a warning. Dead bodies start piling up around her, so she decides on the latter.

""The more solitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained I am, the more I will respect and rely upon myself.""-Charlotte Bronte ALLENTOWN is a beautiful little city of 10,000 inhabitants, situated on the Wabash River, in Vigo County, Ind., in the vicinity of which several railroads now center. It is noted for its elevated position, general healthfulness, and for its beautiful residences and cultivated society. Daniel Lyon located here in 1850. He was a man of marked ability and undoubted integrity; was six feet two inches in height, well proportioned, and of very commanding and martial appearance. In 1861, he was surrounded by a large family, seven grown sons-James, David, Jackson, Peter, Stephen, Henry and Harvey-all of whom were well educated, fond of field sports and inclined to a military life. The mother, ""Aunt Sarah,"" as she was commonly called by the neighbors, was a charming, motherly, Christian woman, whose heart and soul seemed to be wrapped up in the welfare of her family. She was of short, thick build, but rather handsome, with dark brown hair and large blue eyes, gentle and kind. Her politeness and generosity were proverbial. She thought each of her seven sons a model man; her loving remarks about them were noticeable by all. Daniel Lyon is at present 85 years old, and lives with one of his granddaughters-Jennie Lyon-now married to a man by the name of James Wilson, in Oakland, Ind., a small town conspicuous only for its rare educational facilities.",0.00,5:0|4:0|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:0,0,0,382,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1473431327l/31859893._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1473431327l/31859893._SX50_.jpg,1537148273,9781537148274,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31859893-uncle-daniel-s-story-of-tom-anderson-and-twenty-great-battles

There was a simultaneous rear elevation, with the heels at an upward angle of about 45 degrees. Si went sprawling among the bushes. This performance was greeted with great enthusiasm by the fast increasing crowd of spectators. ""I oughter have told you that saddle-mule's the worst bucker in the Army o' the Ohio,"" said the Quartermaster-Sergeant, who was among the onlookers. ""Why, he'd buck off the stripe that runs down his back, if he took it into his measly head. He bucked off a chattel mortgage, and that's the way he come into the army. You can't ride him without using one of Aunt Jemima's sticking plasters."" ""Much obliged for your information. But I will ride him all the same,"" said Si, whose temper had risen to the exploding point. ""I kin ride him if he ties himself in a double bow-knot."" Si was too much of a farmer boy to give in to anything that walked on four legs. He had hung on to the bridle rein, and after addressing a few impressive words to the obstreperous mule he again leaped upon his back. The mule took a docile turn, his motive having apparently been merely to show Si what he could do when he took a notion. The space at command will not permit us to follow Si through all the details of ""hitching up"" that team. He did finally ""git thar, Eli,"" after much strategic effort. The mules brayed and kicked a good deal, and Si's wrath was fully aroused before he got through. He became convinced that soft words were of no account in such a contest, and he enforced discipline by the judicious use of a big club, together with such appropriate language as he could think of. Si hadn't yet learned to swear with that wonderful and appalling proficiency that was so soon acquired by the army teamsters. In the management of mules profanity was considered an invaluable accessory in times of great emergency. At last Si climbed into the saddle, as proud as a King.

Purchasers can download a free scanned copy of the original book (without typos) from the publisher. Not indexed. Not illustrated. 1845 edition. Excerpt: ...sense, reason, or wisdom. Philosophy, in our age, it is that sense of justice to which all men, and women, who have integrity, when they think, judge, and compare by themselves, they do agree without pretention of being more learned than others. The philosopher speaks for better information, and not for the price of being considered more learned than his neighbor. The philosopher is modest: if he speaks of divinity, he does not say to his contender: You have not yet studied the bible enough: and so of mathematics, geology, or astronomy. The philosopher may point out the deficient knowledge which his contender might have of the science; but, he will never ask the impolite question, if he knows the science on which they are discussing. Philosophy, now a days, is no more under the banner of stoicism, peripateticism, cynism, or platonism, which were, at those times, nothing better, than religious sects. In our days, every one, who is able to demonstrate a truth, is a philosopher. And since the reasoning faculties were given to woman as well as to man, I do not see why man would not permit woman to reason as well as himself? Once, being invited to an evening party in Virginia, I was so much pleased in the conversation of a young lady, that, had I not seen many gentlemen smiling and looking askance at us, I think the interesting subject we had on hand, would have taken all our evening time, before we could arrive to the conclusion of it: and nothing is more agreeable at an evening party, when we have matter on hand to keep off the chilling silent look. But, as the smiles at us, were too many, we postponed our subject for another time.

31788,20300040,Double Spy,Peter Van Wermeskerken,"Double Spy is my autobiography as a double agent in East Germany and the Netherlands, from March 1967 to September 1970. While I visited a young woman in Chemnitz, two men approached her, wanting to see me. Soon after, we spoke, and they recruited me as a spy for the HVA (intelligence service of the Ministry of State Security, the STASI). Back in the Netherlands, I immediately reported to the BVD, which 'took me over'. I was only 27 at the time. I had no formal education, and the officers in the HVA-""the People's Army""-were high school graduates, having only attended a 'college' to become a spy. The 'officers' were not capable enough to question me with much success. Their weak attempt to drink me under the table failed miserably, thanks to my epilepsy medication. My story revolves around the Cold War, but it reveals the unhappy lives of the people living under the dictatorship. My life's story celebrates how happy and thankful we should be to live in a free country. Ultimately, Berlin threatened me. My wife convinced me to leave the spy business behind once she conceived our son. My name has surfaced in the STASI archives, but nothing more. This is my story as a Double Spy. Peter van Wermeskerken (born 31-12-1939 Zeist) was 14 when his father asked him to help reporting for his local newspaper. He was co-winner in an essay contest on agricultural cooperative in the EEC (1960). He worked at various newspapers before joining the New Zeister Courant in 1965 to succeed his dad.

The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV. Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who lives alone with her mother and younger sister, regards it as a death sentence when she is forced to represent her district in the Games. But Katniss has been close to dead before - and survival, for her, is second nature. Without really meaning to, she becomes a contender.

SCHIRMER 1911 Copyright, 1907 By FERRUCCIO BUSONI Copyright, 1911 By G. SCHIRMER 22375 JUL, SKETCH OF A NEW ESTHETIC OF MUSIC quot What seek you Say And what do you expect quot I know not what the Unknown I would have What s known to me, is endless I would go Beyond the end The last word still is wanting. quot quot JDer macfitige T OOSELY joined together as regards literary - L form, the following notes are, in reality, the outcome of convictions long held and slowly ma tured. In them a problem of the first magnitude is formulated with apparent simplicity, without giv ing the key to its final solution for the problem cannot be solved for generations if at all. But it involves an innumerable series of lesser problems, which I present to the consideration of those whom they may concern. For it is a long time since any one has devoted himself to earnest musical research. It is true, that admirable works of genius arise in every period, and I have always taken my stand in the front rank of those who joyfully acclaimed the passing standard-bearers and still it seems to me that of all these beautiful paths leading so far afield none lead upward. 2 A NEW ESTHETIC OF MUSIC The spirit of an art-work, the measure of emotion, of humanity, that is in it these remain unchanged in value through changing years the form which these three assumed, the manner of their expression, and the fiawr of the epoch which gave them birth, are transient and age rapidly. Spirit and emotion retain their essence, In the art-work as in man himself we admire technical achievements, yet they areoutstripped, or cloy the taste and are discarded. Its ephemeral qualities give a work the stamp of quot modernity quot its unchangeable essence hinders it from becoming quot obsolete. quot Among both quot mod ern quot and quot old quot works we find good and bad, genuine and spurious. There is nothing properly modern only things which have come into bring earlier or later longer in bloom, or sooner withered. The Modern and the Old have always been. Art-forms are the more lasting, the more closely they adhere to the nature of their individual species of art, the purer they keep their essential means and ends. Sculpture relinquishes the expression of the human pupil, and effects of color painting degener ates, when it forsakes the flat surface in depictioe and takes on complexity in theatrical decoration or panoramic portrayal. Architecture has its fundamental form, growth fern below upward, prescribed by static necessity and K amp gt of necessarily provide the infer CHARACTERIZATION OF THE ARTS 3 mediate and finishing configuration these are eternal and inviolable requirements of the art. Poetry commands the abstract thought, which it clothes in words. More independent than the others, it reaches the furthest bounds. But all arts, resources and forms ever aim at the one end, namely, the imitation of nature and the interpretation of human feelings. Architecture, sculpture, poetry and painting are old and mature arts their conceptions are estab lished and their objects assured they have found the way through uncounted centuries, and, like the planets, describe their regular orbits. Music, compared with them, is a child that has learned to walk, but must still be led. It is a virgin art, without experience in life and suffering. It is all unconscious as yet of what garb is becoming, of its own advantages, its unawakened capacities. And again, it is a child-marvel that is already able to dispense much of beauty, that has already brought joy to many, and whose gifts are commonly held to have attained full maturity...",3.86,5:2|4:2|3:3|2:0|1:0|total:7,5,1,52,Wheeler Press,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1416181316l/9627456._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1416181316l/9627456._SY75_.jpg,1406770183,9781406770186,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9627456-sketch-of-a-new-esthetic-of-music

31811,15132583,Wanderings in South America,Charles Waterton,"For years readers have enjoyed Charles Waterton's intriguing book, Wanderings in South America, about his adventurous travels in Guiana, West Indies. Waterton, a famous English eccentric and naturalist, returned to England in 1821 from an expedition to Guiana, where he had collected hundreds of specimens of South American wildlife, all carefully preserved. On a second expedition to Guiana he acquired the head of an amazing specimen he described as the ""Nondescript,"" a fur-covered, manlike creature native to the South American jungle. Adding a touch of intrigue to this compelling narrative is the rumor that the Nondescript bears a startling resemblance to an overzealous customs inspector who had caused him so much grief upon his return in 1821. It is popular opinion that Waterton, in his own peculiar way, was literally trying to ""make a monkey"" out of an annoying tax collector. AUTHOR BIO: Naturalist and explorer Charles Waterton (1782-1865) was born in Yorkshire, England, to a family eminent in the service of the state. In 1796, he pursued higher studies at Stonyhurst, where he developed his early passion for natural history. Determined to start exploring the hinterland of Guiana at intervals of four years, he made the four adventurous expeditions described in the well-known Wanderings in South America.",3.86,5:2|4:9|3:2|2:1|1:0|total:14,3,0,,Echo Library,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1846375827,9781846375828,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15132583-wanderings-in-south-america

31824,4953,A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius,Dave Eggers,"'When you read his extraordinary memoir you don't laugh, then cry, then laugh again; you somehow experience these emotions all at once.'<br /><br />""Well, this was when Bill was sighing a lot. He had decided that after our parents died he just didn't want any more fighting between what was left of us. He was twenty-four, Beth was twenty-three, I was twenty-one, Toph was eight, and all of us were so tried already, from that winter. So when something would come up, any little thing, some bill to pay or decision to make, he would just sigh, his eyes tired, his mouth in a sorry kind of smile. <br /><br />But Beth and I...Jesus, we were fighting with everyone, anyone, each other, with strangers at bars, anywhere -- we were angry people wanting to exact revenge. We came to California and we wanted everything, would take what was ours, anything within reach. And I decided that little Toph and I, he with his backward hat and long hair, living together in our little house in Berkeley, would be world-destroyers. We inherited each other and, we felt, a responsibility to reinvent everything, to scoff and re-create and drive fast while singing loudly and pounding the windows. It was a hopeless sort of exhilaration, a kind of arrogance born of fatalism, I guess, of the feeling that if you could lose a couple of parents in a month, then basically anything could happen, at any time -- all bullets bear your name, all cars are there to crush you, any balcony could give way; more disaster seemed only logical. <br /><br />And then, as in Dorothy's dream, all these people I grew up with were there, too, some of them orphans also, most but not all of us believing that what we had been given was extraordinary, that it was time to tear or break down, ruin, remake, take and devour. This was San Francisco, you know, and everyone had some dumb idea -- I mean, wicca? -- and no one there would tell you yours was doomed. Thus the public nudity, and this ridiculous magazine, and the Real World tryout, all this need, most of it disguised by sneering, but all driven by a hyper-awareness of this window, I guess, a few years when your muscles are taut, coiled up and vibrating. But what to do with the energy? I mean, when we drive, Toph and I, and we drive past people, standing on top of all these hills, part of me wants to stop the car and turn up the radio and have us all dance in formation, and part of me wants to run them all over.""",3.68,5:44777|4:53627|3:37631|2:16494|1:8404|total:160933,155688,8408,485,Vintage,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327714834l/4953._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327714834l/4953._SY75_.jpg,0375725784,9780375725784,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4953.A_Heartbreaking_Work_of_Staggering_Genius

Marcy, as we know, was loyal to the old flag but he had had few opportunities to prove it, until he took his brother, Sailor Jack, out to the Federal blockading fleet in his little schooner Fairy Belle, to give him a chance to enlist in the navy. That was by far the most dangerous undertaking in which Marcy had ever engaged, and at the time of which we write, he had not seen the beginning of the trouble it was destined to bring him. Not only was he liable to be overhauled by the Confederates when he attempted to pass their forts at Plymouth and Roanoke Island, but he was in danger of being shot to pieces by the watchful steam launches of the Union fleet that had of late taken to patrolling the coast. But he came through without any very serious mishaps, and returned to his home to find the plantation in an uproar, and his mother in a most anxious frame of mind.",3.00,5:0|4:1|3:0|2:1|1:0|total:2,2,0,,,eng,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21172020-marcy-the-refugee
