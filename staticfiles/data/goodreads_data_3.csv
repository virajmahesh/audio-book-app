That was Olga’s role. <br /> <br />Then a tragic accident on the busiest street in Chicago leaves Olga dead and Julia left behind to reassemble the shattered pieces of her family.

With the help of her best friend Lorena, and her first kiss, first love, first everything boyfriend Connor, Julia is determined to find out. Was Olga really what she seemed?

40034,9032666,The Princess Dehra,John Reed Scott,"For the first time in a generation the Castle of Lotzen was entertaining its lord. He had come suddenly, a month before, and presently there had followed rumors of strange happenings in Dornlitz, in which the Duke had been too intimately concerned to please the King, and as punishment had been banished to his mountain estates. But Lotzenia was far from the Capital and isolated, and the people cared more for their crops and the amount of the tax levy than for the doings of the Court. And so it concerned them very little why the red banner with the golden cross floated from the highest turret of the old pile of stone, on the spur of the mountain overhanging the foaming Dreer. They knew it meant the Duke himself was in presence; but to them there was but one over-lord: the Dalberg, who reigned in Dornlitz; and in him they had all pride-for was not the Dalberg their hereditary chieftain centuries before he was the King! True, the Duke of Lotzen had long been the Heir Presumptive, and so, in the prospective, entitled to their loyalty, but lately there had come from across the Sea a new Dalberg, of the blood of the great Henry, who, it was said, had displaced him in the line of Succession, and was to marry the Princess Dehra.",3.25,5:0|4:2|3:1|2:1|1:0|total:4,3,0,,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,2940005774200,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9032666-the-princess-dehra

40038,15719616,The Lone Ranger Rides,Fran Striker,"In a remote basin in the western part of Texas, the Cavendish clan raised cattle. From the vast level acreage, where longhorns grew fat on lush grass, the surrounding hills looked verdant and hospitable; but this was pure deceit on Nature's part. Those hills were treacherous, and Bryant Cavendish loved them for that selfsame treachery. Sitting on the porch of his rambling house, the bitter old man spat tobacco-flavored curses at the infirmities that restricted him. His legs, tortured by rheumatism, were propped on a bentwood chair, and seemed slim and out of proportion to his barrel-shaped torso. His eyes, like caves beneath an overhanging ledge, were more restless than usual, as he gazed across the basin. He rasped a heavy thumbnail across the bristle of his slablike jowl. There was something in the air he couldn't explain. He felt a vague uneasiness despite the almost pastoral scene before him. He scanned the hills on all sides of the basin, knowing that no stranger could come through the tangle of underbrush and dense forest. Those hills had always been practically impassable. Then his restless eyes fell on the weird riot of color to the north. That was Bryant's Gap. Water flowing from the basin springs had patiently, through countless ages, cut the deep cleft in solid rock. The walls towering high on each side reflected unbelievable hues. Bryant's scowl deepened as he observed the Gap.",3.78,5:32|4:37|3:39|2:8|1:1|total:117,83,22,263,Putnam,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1341303463l/15719616._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1341303463l/15719616._SX50_.jpg,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15719616-the-lone-ranger-rides

In giving the postdiluvians a description of the creation, and first location of man, how mankind corrupted themselves, and how God destroyed them with a flood, he simply stated the principal facts, and gave a description of the location—and it not being on that continent, he could not point it out to them—and as the country in which Noah then resided, was all new to him, and his family, no one knew where it was; nor was any one able then, or since, to find it on that continent; thus, the location, though admitted to be somewhere on earth, has been kept a profound mystery to the present time, and consequently the innocent cause of no little speculation. But by degrees it has been opening to the minds of some, that the first habitation of man must have been somewhere on the American Continent; and the finger of time has been plainly pointing to what is known as the “North West,” as the place. But of this last fact I was ignorant when I made the discovery of the garden, and commenced developing the facts about it. The discovery, resulted from my familiarity with, or thorough knowledge of the Bible, and standing on the hanging garden and looking over the plat, and admiring its most wonderful scenery, and counting the rivers, I became sensibly impressed by a suggestion, This is the garden of Eden: at which suggestion I smiled, as the plat, to me then, was altogether too large. Of course I had never given it thought, nor measured it up in my own mind to what should, or might be its proper dimensions. However so strong were my impressions, that I, as a matter of pleasantry, used, occasionally to say to my friends, this is the Garden of Eden.<br /><br />Since I commenced to publish my views, claiming a possible reality, while some have mocked, others are becoming impressed with the idea of its being not only possible, but highly probable. Where would a scientist place the first pair, to acclimate, and from which to make man, as he now is, an inhabitant of all the earth? Not too far north, not too far south. Our garden is in that place. It should be destitute of money mineral wealth, as these, if easily obtained, are corrupting in their tendencies, and should be sought, and toiled for, to be properly enjoyed; and should be placed at a distance, just where God says he provided it, at the head of the stream. Our garden is still in the right place. From inherited wealth and luxury comes danger to the inheritors. Our garden is again right. But it should be a place susceptible of, and adapted to moral and intellectual growth, and lead to the admiration, adoration, and worship of the great Builder of the universe, the Infinite and Perfect. Is there a better place for that, in all this beautiful earth, than is our garden, and its surroundings? If there is, we would like to see it.<br /><br />I have related the facts as they have been presented to me, or as I have discovered them, and believe the reader will be pleased and profited with the results, and I hope this will lead to more thorough and satisfactory investigation.<br /><br />THE AUTHOR.",0.00,5:0|4:0|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:0,0,0,,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30334608-found-at-last

40075,1418076,The Knights of Malta,H.J.A. Sire,"This is the most complete history in any language of the Order of St John, or Knights Hospitaller, successively known as the Knights of Rhodes and of Malta. Founded in eleventh-century Jerusalem, the Order has played an important military, religious and political role over succeeding centuries. H.J.A. Sire not only provides a full narrative account, but describes and illustrates the architectural and artistic legacy of the Knights, from Crusader castles in the Holy Land, to the medieval city of Rhodes, the Maltese capital of Valletta, and manors, churches and fortified villages throughout Europe. These, as well as religious art, portraiture and illuminated manuscripts are copiously illustrated, revealing the wealth, culture and longevity of the Order. This is moreover the first general work to do full justice to the Order's international character by including a detailed account of its European Priories and the role played by the Knights in the history of their respective countries. It includes chapters on Crac des Chevaliers and other Hospitaller castles of the crusading period, on the career of Grand Master Heredia as a statesman and patron of medieval learning, and on the caring traditions of the Order. The chapter on the Navy of the Knights offers the first rigorous study of the Order's strategic naval role in the Mediterranean. The final section describes the resurgence of the Order since Napoleon's conquest of Malta in 1798, and its efforts over two centuries to recover an effective role. It considers the attempt in the 1950s to subject the Order to Vatican control, and its position today, under the first English Grand Master in its history. With its traditional rights ofsovereignty widely recognised, and diplomatic relations established with an increasing number of countries, a modernised Order of over ten thousand Knights continues nine centuries of hospitaller work throughout the world.",3.59,5:3|4:6|3:6|2:2|1:0|total:17,15,2,,Yale University Press,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328871053l/1418076._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328871053l/1418076._SX50_.jpg,0300068859,9780300068856,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1418076.The_Knights_of_Malta

Dewey's lectures have lost none of their vigor … The historical approach, which underlay the central argument, is beautifully exemplified in his treatments of the origin of philosophy."" — <i>Philosophy and Phenomenological Research</i>.<br />""It was with this book that Dewey fully launched his campaign for experimental philosophy."" — <i>The New Republic.<br /></i>Written shortly after the shattering effects of World War I, John Dewey's <i>Reconstruction in Philosophy </i>offers an insightful introduction to the concept of pragmatic humanism. The eminent philosopher presents persuasive arguments against traditional philosophical constructs, suggesting their basis in self-justification; instead, he proposes an examination of core values in terms of their ultimate effects on the self and others. Dewey's experimental philosophy represented a significant departure from its predecessor, utilitarianism, and it was received with both outrage and acclaim for daring to mingle ethics and science.<br />Delivered in 1919 as a series of lectures at Tokyo's Imperial University of Japan, Dewey's landmark work appears here in an enlarged edition that features an informative introduction by the author, written more than 25 years after the book's initial publication.",3.98,5:83|4:74|3:56|2:8|1:5|total:226,179,9,176,Dover Publications,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328864339l/1558136._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328864339l/1558136._SY75_.jpg,0486434389,9780486434384,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1558136.Reconstruction_in_Philosophy

40095,17202231,Des Jésuites,Jules Michelet,"Résumé<br /><br />Un pamphlet contre l'ordre des Jésuites, accusé de véhiculer l'obscurantisme et la vertu d'obéissance comme maximes de vie. Texte suivi d'un extrait des«Exercices spirituels»d'Ignace de Loyola et d'un article sur les jésuites de Voltaire.<br /><br /><br />Quatrième de couverture<br /><br />Rejetés dès le XVIIIe siècle de plusieurs pays d'Europe, y compris par la hiérarchie papale romaine, et condamnés à la dissolution, les jésuites semblent alors avoir disparu de la vie religieuse et surtout de la vie politique française. Sous Napoléon et le Concordat, et même sous Charles X, ils paraissent ne plus devoir jouer le rôle qu'ils jouaient auparavant. Sous la monarchie de Juillet, qui ne reconnait aucune religion comme religion d'État, ils réapparaissent et entreprennent la reconquête de leurs prérogatives et de leur influence. Au nom de la «liberté de l'enseignement», ils tentent d'empêcher les cours d'histoire que tiennent Jules Michelet et Edgar Quinet au Collège de France, en perturbant les séances de façon parfois très agitée. Au nom de la «liberté religieuse», ils mettent la main sur les églises de campagne, sur les établissements d'enseignement. Dans le climat politique fiévreux qui précède de quelques années la Révolution de 1848, les républicains contre-attaquent. Les cours de Michelet et d'Edgar Quinet au Collège de France sont largement relayés par la presse. Ils fournissent ainsi les éléments historiques nécessaires à tous ceux qui ne veulent pas voir revenir les jésuites dans l'enseignement, dans l'Église de France, dans les missions à l'étranger, et de façon plus générale dans la vie politique et sociale française. C'est cette mémoire qui revit, ce sont ces cours que l'on trouvera ici. Ils constituent un modèle de combat pour lutter avec les armes de la vérité des faits et de l'histoire contre toute religion ou ordre religieux qui tente peu à peu de dénaturer la République et ses valeurs en remportant graduellement des positions dans la vie sociale et intellectuelle, profitant de ce que Michelet et Quinet nomment le «sommeil de mort». À ce point de vue, leur enseignement demeure d'une pleine et brûlante actualité.",4.00,5:1|4:0|3:1|2:0|1:0|total:2,1,1,204,Coda,fre,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1357076022l/17202231._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1357076022l/17202231._SX50_.jpg,,9782849670866,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17202231-des-j-suites

This “abounding, ebullient, effervescent emotion” manifests itself everywhere from child’s play to scientific breakthrough and is crucially important to learning, risk-taking, social cohesiveness, and survival itself. <b>Exuberance: The Passion for Life</b> introduces us to such notably irrepressible types as Teddy Roosevelt, John Muir, and Richard Feynman, as well as Peter Pan, dancing porcupines, and Charles Schulz’s Snoopy. It explores whether exuberance can be inherited, parses its neurochemical grammar, and documents the methods people have used to stimulate it.

Cynonycteris Peters, Reise nach Mossambique, p. 25.

The subspecies Rousettus amplexicaudatus hedigeri appears to be the sole representative of this genus in the Solomon Islands. Prior to 1953, several workers (Thomas, 1887b:323, 1888b:475; Matschie, 1899:68; Sanborn, 1931:11) used the name Rousettus amplexicaudatus brachyotis for it, but Pohle (1953) suggested that the specimens from the Solomons recorded by earlier workers were R. a. hedigeri named by him on the basis of the specimen that he saw from Bougainville.[...].",4.00,5:0|4:1|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:1,1,0,74,Createspace,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1444643396l/26624471._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1444643396l/26624471._SX50_.jpg,1506144403,9781506144405,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26624471-systematics-of-megachiropteran-bats-in-the-solomon-islands

Had any one, a week before his daughter arrived, told Colonel Stuart that her presence would be a pleasant restraint upon him, he would have been very angry. Yet such was the fact. Her likeness to her mother carried him back to days when his peccadilloes could still be regarded as youthful follies, and people spared a harsh verdict on what age might be expected to remedy. Then her vast admiration gave a reality to his own assumptions of rectitude; for the Colonel clung theoretically to virtue with great tenacity, in a loud-voiced, conservative ""d you if you don't believe what I say"" sort of manner. He also maintained a high ideal in regard to the honour of every one else, based on a weak-kneed conviction that his own was above suspicion. He was proud of Belle too, fully recognising that with her by his side his grey hairs became reverend. So he pulled himself up to some small degree, and began to sprinkle good advice among the younger men with edifying gravity. As for Belle she was supremely happy. No doubt had she been ""earnest"" or ""soulful"" or ""intense"" she might have found spots on her sun with the greatest ease; but she was none of these things. At this period of her existence nothing was further from her disposition than inward questionings on any subject. She took life as she found it, seeing only her own healthy, happy desires in its dreary old problems, and remaining as utterly unconscious that she was assimilating herself to her surroundings as the caterpillar which takes its colour from 'the leaf on which it feeds. For a healthy mind acts towards small worries as the skin does towards friction; it protects itself from pain by an excess of vitality. It is only when pressure breaks through the blister that its extent is realised.

He transformed the world of decorated children's books in the Victorian era. In 1877, he was asked by Edmund Evans, the colour printer and talented engraver, to illustrate two children's books. These books were an immediate success and he went on to produce two books every Christmas until he died. Caldecott chose all the stories and rhymes he illustrated and occasionally wrote and added to the stories himself. His delightful style and humour can still be enjoyed by young and old alike. This story, 'Sing A Song For Sixpence', was originally published in 1880. Many of the earliest children's books, particularly those dating back to the 1900s and before, are now extremely scarce and increasingly expensive.

40159,30959635,"Emma, by: Jane Austen, A NOVEL about youthful hubris and the perils of misconstrued romance (Original Version)",Jane Austen,"Emma, by Jane Austen, is a novel about youthful hubris and the perils of misconstrued romance. The novel was first published in December 1815. As in her other novels, Austen explores the concerns and difficulties of genteel women living in Georgian-Regency England; she also creates a lively comedy of manners among her characters. Before she began the novel, Austen wrote, ""I am going to take a heroine whom no one but myself will much like."" In the first sentence she introduces the title character as ""Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich."" Emma is spoiled, headstrong, and self-satisfied; she greatly overestimates her own matchmaking abilities; she is blind to the dangers of meddling in other people's lives; and her imagination and perceptions often lead her astray. This novel has been adapted for several films, many television programs, and a long list of stage plays.Emma Woodhouse has just attended the wedding of Miss Taylor, her friend and former governess, to Mr Weston. Having introduced them, Emma takes credit for their marriage, and decides that she likes matchmaking. After she returns home to Hartfield with her father, Emma forges ahead with her new interest against the advice of Mr Knightley and tries to match her new friend Harriet Smith to Mr Elton, the local vicar. First, Emma must persuade Harriet to refuse the marriage proposal from Robert Martin, a respectable, educated, and well-spoken young farmer, which Harriet does against her own wishes. But Mr Elton, a social climber, thinks Emma is in love with him and proposes to her. When Emma tells him that she had thought him attached to Harriet, he is outraged. After Emma rejects him, Mr Elton leaves for a stay at Bath and returns with a pretentious, nouveau-riche wife, as Mr Knightley expected. Harriet is heartbroken and Emma feels ashamed about misleading her. Frank Churchill, Mr Weston's son, arrives for a two-week visit to his father and makes many friends. Mr Knightley suggests to Emma that while Frank is clever and engaging, he is also a shallow character. Jane Fairfax comes home to see her aunt, Miss Bates, and grandmother, Mrs Bates, for a few months, before she must go out on her own as a governess. She is the same age as Emma, but Emma has not been as friendly with her as she might. Emma envies her talent and is annoyed to find all, including Mrs Weston and Mr Knightley, praising Jane. The patronising Mrs Elton takes Jane under her wing and announces that she will find her the ideal governess post before it is wanted. Emma begins to feel some sympathy for Jane's predicament. Emma decides that Jane and Mr Dixon are mutually attracted, and that is why she has come home. She shares her suspicions with Frank, who met Jane and the Campbells at a vacation spot a year earlier, and he apparently agrees with her. Suspicions are further fueled when a piano, sent by an anonymous benefactor, arrives for Jane. Emma feels herself falling in love with Frank, but it does not last to his second visit. The Eltons treat Harriet badly, culminating with Mr Elton publicly snubbing Harriet at the ball given by the Westons in May. Mr Knightley, who had long refrained from dancing, gallantly steps in to dance with Harriet. The day after the ball, Frank brings Harriet to Hartfield, she having fainted after a rough encounter with local gypsies. Harriet is grateful, and Emma thinks this is love, not gratitude. Meanwhile, Mrs Weston wonders if Mr Knightley has taken a fancy to Jane but Emma dismisses that idea. When Mr Knightley mentions the links he sees between Jane and Frank, Emma denies them, while Frank appears to be courting her instead.

40161,29981,The Island of Doctor Moreau,H.G. Wells,"Ranked among the classic novels of the English language and the inspiration for several unforgettable movies, this early work of H. G. Wells was greeted in 1896 by howls of protest from reviewers, who found it horrifying and blasphemous. They wanted to know more about the wondrous possibilities of science shown in his first book, <i>The Time Machine</i>, not its potential for misuse and terror. In <i>The Island of Dr. Moreau</i>, a shipwrecked gentleman named Edward Prendick, stranded on a Pacific island lorded over by the notorious Dr. Moreau, confronts dark secrets, strange creatures, and a reason to run for his life.<br /><br />While this riveting tale was intended to be a commentary on evolution, divine creation, and the tension between human nature and culture, modern readers familiar with genetic engineering will marvel at Wells’s prediction of the ethical issues raised by producing “smarter” human beings or bringing back extinct species. These levels of interpretation add a richness to Prendick’s adventures on Dr. Moreau’s island of lost souls without distracting from what is still a rip-roaring good read.",3.73,5:18400|4:33008|3:26792|2:5902|1:1061|total:85163,70280,2359,153,Bantam Classics,eng,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,0553214322,9780553214321,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29981.The_Island_of_Doctor_Moreau

40175,1168341,Physics of the Impossible,Michio Kaku,"A fascinating exploration of the science of the impossible—from death rays and force fields to invisibility cloaks—revealing to what extent such technologies might be achievable decades or millennia into the future.<br /><br />One hundred years ago, scientists would have said that lasers, televisions, and the atomic bomb were beyond the realm of physical possibility. In Physics of the Impossible, the renowned physicist Michio Kaku explores to what extent the technologies and devices of science fiction that are deemed equally impossible today might well become commonplace in the future.<br /><br />From teleportation to telekinesis, Kaku uses the world of science fiction to explore the fundamentals—and the limits—of the laws of physics as we know them today. He ranks the impossible technologies by categories—Class I, II, and III, depending on when they might be achieved, within the next century, millennia, or perhaps never. In a compelling and thought-provoking narrative, he explains:<br />· How the science of optics and electromagnetism may one day enable us to bend light around an object, like a stream flowing around a boulder, making the object invisible to observers “downstream”<br />· How ramjet rockets, laser sails, antimatter engines, and nanorockets may one day take us to the nearby stars<br />· How telepathy and psychokinesis, once considered pseudoscience, may one day be possible using advances in MRI, computers, superconductivity, and nanotechnology<br />· Why a time machine is apparently consistent with the known laws of quantum physics, although it would take an unbelievably advanced civilization to actually build one<br />Kaku uses his discussion of each technology as a jumping-off point to explain the science behind it. An extraordinary scientific adventure, Physics of the Impossible takes readers on an unforgettable, mesmerizing journey into the world of science that both enlightens and entertains.",4.08,5:12105|4:10719|3:5063|2:1213|1:737|total:29837,26692,916,329,Doubleday Books,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320469147l/1168341._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320469147l/1168341._SY75_.jpg,0385520697,9780385520690,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1168341.Physics_of_the_Impossible

40187,748634,Modern Geographical,Richard Peet,"Richard Peet looks in detail at the main trends in human geographic thought over the last thirty years, relating these to broader themes in philosophy and social theory. Beginning with existential phenomenology and humanistic geography, the book covers Marxism and radical geography, structuralism, structuration theory, realism, locality studies, various streams of poststructuralism and postmodernism, and feminism.<br /><br /> Each chapter examines a few theories in depth, concentrating on the major works and the nature of their contribution. Many of the ideas covered are dense and complex, but the reader is drawn gradually into the text through notions understandable to students. After spending time with this book the reader should be able to tackle virtually any philosophical theme in contemporary geographic thought.<br /><br /> The book will be central to courses in geographical thought and the history of geographical thought, and as part of virtually all courses in human geography whcih entail philosophy and theory.",3.70,5:4|4:8|3:6|2:2|1:0|total:20,20,2,356,John Wiley & Sons,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1557863784,9781557863782,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/748634.Modern_Geographical

Remsburg,"Excerpt from Thomas Paine, the Apostle of Liberty: An Address Delivered in Chicago, January 29, 1916, Including the Testimony of Five Hundred Witnesses <br />From time immemorial men have observed the natal days of their gods and heroes. A few weeks ago Christians celebrated the birthday of a god. We come to celebrate the birthday of a man. <br />Within the brief space of twenty-five days occur the anniversaries of the births of the three most remarkable men that have appeared on this continent - Paine, Washington and Lincoln - the Creator, the Defender and the Savior of our Republic. To do honor to the memory of the first of these - to acknowledge our indebtedness to him as a patriot and philosopher, and to extol his virtues as a man - have we assembled here. We come the more willingly and our exercises will be characterized by a deeper earnestness because the one whose merits we celebrate has been the victim of almost infinite injustice. In the popular mind to utter a word in his behalf has been to apologize for wrong to - declare yourself the friend of Paine has been to declare yourself the enemy of man. The world is not prepared to do him full justice yet. Priest-craft, still powerful, uses all its power to prejudice the public mind against him and in too many hearts, where love and gratitude should dwell, ingratitude and hatred have their home.

Looking for respite in London after a stupefying visit from relatives, Mary encounters a friend from Oxford. The young woman introduces Mary to her current enthusiasm, a strange and enigmatic woman named Margery Childe, who leads something called ""The New Temple of God."" It seems to be a charismatic sect involved in the post-World War I suffrage movement, with a feminist slant on Christianity. Mary is curious about the woman, and intrigued. Is the New Temple a front for something more sinister? When a series of murders claims members of the movement's wealthy young female volunteers and principal contributors, Mary, with Holmes in the background, begins to investigate. Things become more desperate than either of them expected as Mary's search plunges her into the worst danger she has yet faced.",4.04,5:6736|4:9074|3:4305|2:649|1:132|total:20896,17459,1202,336,HarperCollins,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1334169424l/104737._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1334169424l/104737._SY75_.jpg,0006514944,9780006514947,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/104737.A_Monstrous_Regiment_of_Women

Purchasers can usually download a free scanned copy of the original book (without typos) from the publisher. Not indexed. Not illustrated. 1921 edition. Excerpt: ... CHAPTER VI GOOD-BYE TO OLD HAUNTS AND FACES That some extraordinary thing was afoot next day, every soul who worked in our store, or who entered it on business, vaguely felt. To me, who had gained a hint of what was going forward, -- baffling and tantalizing, yet a hint for all that, -- and to Arnold Lamont, who, I was convinced as I saw him watch my uncle's nervous movements, although he had no such plain hint to go upon, had by his keen, silent observation unearthed even more than I, the sense of an impending great event was far from vague. I felt as sure as of my own name that before nightfall something would happen to uproot me from my native town, whose white houses and green trees and hedges, kindly people and familiar associations, lovely scenes and quiet, homely life I so deeply loved. The strange light in Cornelius Gleazen's eyes, as he watched us hard at work taking an inventory of stock, confirmed me in the presentiment. My uncle's harassed, nervous manner as he drove us on with our various duties, Sim Muzzy's garrulous bewilderment, and Arnold Lamont's keen, silent appraisal, added each its little to the sum of my convictions. The warmer the day grew, the harder we worked. Uncle Seth flew about like a madman, picking us up on this thing and that, and urging one to greater haste, another to greater care. Throwing off his coat, he pitched in with his own hands, and performed such prodigies of labor that it seemed as if our force were doubled by the addition of himself alone. And all the time Neil Gleazen sat and smiled and tapped his beaver. He was so cool, so impudent about it, that I longed to turn on him and vent my spleen; but to Uncle Seth it apparently seemed entirely suitable that Gleazen should idle while others...",2.79,5:3|4:8|3:22|2:15|1:5|total:53,0,0,96,Theclassics.Us,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1230294279,9781230294278,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20269050-the-great-quest-a-romance-of-1826-wherein-are-recorded-the-experiences

40269,29105889,The Black Rocks of Morwenstow,John Wilcox,"1842. Joshua Weyland is languishing in America and desperate to return to England and his fianc�. He ships home on a small brig but when it founders on rocks off the coast of Cornwall and he narrowly escapes with his life, it's clear to him that the ship had been deliberately wrecked. Who could be responsible? From the eccentric doctor and his daughter who nurse him back to health, to the local fishermen, tin miners and 'Preventers' tasked with subduing smuggling activity, Joshua has plenty of questions which could land him in serious trouble. When an epic storm erupts and another ship is in peril, Joshua is forced to fight for his life to avert disaster and get to the bottom of the mystery.",3.25,5:4|4:4|3:7|2:3|1:2|total:20,12,5,320,Allison & Busby,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,0749017295,9780749017293,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29105889-the-black-rocks-of-morwenstow

She was as wanton as a Polynesian dancer and as demanding as a nympho. Beth Danson was about twenty-five and, besides her deep auburn-brown hair and lovely face, she boasted an equally attractive body. He found himself captivated by the warm thrust of her breasts beneath the silk blouse. The clear milk of her flesh, at the “V” of her throat excited him in a strange way. When he thought of her as his wife, it was frightening. It was as though someone had tossed him a woman and expected him to just fall into the routine of marriage. It wouldn’t be hard to come to love this woman, but it would take awhile. Hell, he didn’t know her. She was a complete stranger who had suddenly told him they were married.

Excerpt: ...of the Duke of Athole, and of Mr. Farquharson of Invercauld."" 3 ""Tales,"" II. 107. The story referred to is on pp. 102-6. And the latter inference is, in point of fact, the right one; if we do not restrict lon-dnbh to the precise meaning of ""black elk."" Mr. J. F. Campbell not only tells us that certain ""great antlered deer ""were formerly hunted by the Feens, but he also points out Sutherlandshire traditions which tell how witches and fairies used to milk the female deer. And this statement forms one of the reasons which lead him to believe that Fairies, Picts, and Lapps were practically one people; for his deduction therefrom is this: --"" Fairies, then, milked deer, as Lapps do."" Now, the point of this is that the deer milked by the Lapps is the reindeer, and not any variety of deer now existing in the British Islands. Mr. Campbell's further reference to ""a story published by Grant Stewart, in which a ghost uses a herd of deer to carry her furniture,"" quite bears out his belief that the reindeer was domesticated, as well as hunted, by the little people. And it is an actual historical fact that the reindeer was hunted in Caithness so recently as the twelfth century. In a very full and exhaustive ""Notice of Remains of the Rein-Deer, Cervus tarandus, found in Ross-shire, Sutherland, and Caithness,""1 the late Dr. John A. Smith, Sec. S. A., Scot, has pointed out that the seventeenth-century historian, Torfaeus, mentions that it was the custom of two earls of Orkney, during the twelfth century, to cross over to Caithness from the Orkneys, for the purpose of hunting the roe-deer and the reindeer.

A wealth of association and historic data is to be acquired from the study of the ""fabrique marks"" and periods of the master craftsmen. If in America there was a general tendency toward acquiring, even a smattering, of this knowledge, there would be less of these drawing-room atrocities which Arthur Hayden in his ""Chats on English Earthenware"" points out, ""To have a modern set of vases adorning a Georgian cabinet is like putting new wine in old bottles.""",2.00,5:0|4:1|3:0|2:0|1:2|total:3,3,1,,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24150802-china-and-pottery-marks

Their names are Hem and Haw.<br /><br />""Cheese"" is a metaphor for what you want to have in life—whether it is a good job, a loving relationship, money, a possession, health, or spiritual peace of mind.<br /><br />And the ""Maze"" is where you look for what you want—the organization you work in, or the family or community you live in.<br /><br />In the story, the characters are faced with unexpected change. Eventually, one of them deals with it successfully, and writes what he has learned from his experience on the Maze walls.<br /><br />When you come to see ""The Handwriting on the Wall,"" you can discover for yourself how to deal with change, so that you can enjoy less stress and more success (however you define it) in your work and in your life. <br /><br />Written for all ages, the story takes less than an hour to read, but its unique insights can last a lifetime.",3.79,5:106872|4:98950|3:75560|2:27868|1:14715|total:323965,298335,8067,96,Vermilion,eng,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,0091883768,9780091883768,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4894.Who_Moved_My_Cheese_

At once a Gothic thriller, a passionate romance, and a cautionary tale about the dangers of science, <i>Frankenstein</i> tells the story of committed science student Victor Frankenstein. Obsessed with discovering the cause of generation and life and bestowing animation upon lifeless matter, Frankenstein assembles a human being from stolen body parts but; upon bringing it to life, he recoils in horror at the creature's hideousness. Tormented by isolation and loneliness, the once-innocent creature turns to evil and unleashes a campaign of murderous revenge against his creator, Frankenstein.<br /><br /><i>Frankenstein</i>, an instant bestseller and an important ancestor of both the horror and science fiction genres, not only tells a terrifying story, but also raises profound, disturbing questions about the very nature of life and the place of humankind within the cosmos: What does it mean to be human? What responsibilities do we have to each other? How far can we go in tampering with Nature? In our age, filled with news of organ donation genetic engineering, and bio-terrorism, these questions are more relevant than ever.",3.79,5:309104|4:360837|3:266087|2:83694|1:33392|total:1053114,12820,776,324,Pocket Books,eng,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,0743487583,9780743487580,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18488.Frankenstein_or_the_Modern_Prometheus

40342,434472,"Sugar Changed the World: A Story of Magic, Spice, Slavery, Freedom, and Science",Marc Aronson,"When this award-winning husband-and-wife team discovered that they each had sugar in their family history, they were inspired to trace the globe-spanning story of the sweet substance and to seek out the voices of those who led bitter sugar lives. The trail ran like a bright band from religious ceremonies in India to Europe’s Middle Ages, then on to Columbus, who brought the first cane cuttings to the Americas.

40343,1053463,Lilian's Story,Kate Grenville,"Shielded from emotional and physical abuse by layers of fat, Lilian struggles to escape a suffocating existence in the home of her tyrannical Victorian father and her elegant but ineffectual mother. Madness, cruelty, and sexuality permeate the family's upper-crust Australian world. Lilian Una Singer starts life at the beginning of the 20th century as the daughter of a prosperous middle-class Australian family. She ends it as a cheerfully eccentric bag-lady living on the streets, quoting Shakespeare. This book traces the progress of her life's journey, and why she made the choices she did. She's a person large in spirit as well as body, who wants to invent her own story, rather than allow it to be invented for her. Life presents her with many obstacles, including the sinister advances of her father—but in spite of this she succeeds. Triumphantly she makes her life her own, savoring every moment with the reminder that ""everything matters.""<br /><br /><br />",3.67,5:281|4:482|3:344|2:105|1:49|total:1261,1056,75,280,Canongate UK,eng,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1841959952,9781841959955,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1053463.Lilian_s_Story

These selected paragraphs distill the contents and give you a quick look inside The Coward Behind the Curtain:<br /><br />Look inside the book:<br /><br />In that moment of her desperation, if she had only known where money was to be had, she would have made free with it, if the thing were possible, even without the owner's sanction, oblivious of any consequences which her action might entail; being persuaded that no worse fate could befall her than that that man should find her still in the room when he came back. ...His pose; his attitude; his disordered attire; something which looked out of his eyes; the obvious mental agitation which caused his countenance to wear that singular hue; the gleam of scarlet which was all that marked his tightly closed mouth; the ominous fashion in which, while standing perfectly still, he never took his glance from off the man in front of him--although she might not have been able to put the thing into words, everything about him spoke to the sensitive imagination of the girl of one who, for a very little, would throw everything aside in the fullness of his desire to gratify the lust of his rage. ...Yet, disposed as he evidently was to be as disagreeable as he could be, his rage altogether lacked that quality of intensity, of white heat, which marked the other; the something which caused the girl, when she appreciated, though only vaguely, the scene which was being enacted before her, to feel that it would be well that, at the earliest possible moment, she should make her presence known, for Mr Emmett's protection.<br /><br />About Richard Marsh, the Author:<br /><br />A story about a mysterious oriental figure who pursues a British politician to London, where he wreaks havoc with his powers of hypnosis and shape-shifting, Marsh's novel is of a piece with other sensational turn of the 19th to 20th century fictions such as Stoker's Dracula, George du Maurier's Trilby, and Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu novels. Like Dracula and many of the sensation novels pioneered by Wilkie Collins and others in the 1860s, The Beetle is narrated from the perspectives of multiple characters, a technique used in many late 19th-century novels (those of Wilkie Collins and Stoker, for example) to create suspense and to confuse gender boundaries.",4.00,5:1|4:0|3:1|2:0|1:0|total:2,1,0,112,Tebbo,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1365406118l/17677461._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1365406118l/17677461._SX50_.jpg,1486440487,9781486440481,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17677461-the-coward-behind-the-curtain---the-original-classic-edition

Hoping to earn enough money to finally marry his true love, Daisy Strong, Cyril invests his savings in the stock market, and loses it all. Ruined and on the brink of emigrating to flee his creditors, he reads with amusement a newspaper story telling of the brazen robbery of the Duchess of Datchet's diamonds, worth half a million pounds. But who can imagine his surprise when he returns home and finds, thanks to a luggage mix-up on the train, that he is in possession of the jewels!<br /><br />Cyril is at first elated at his change of fortune, but he may not be so lucky as it seems. Inspector John Ireland of Scotland Yard is hot on his trail, suspecting him of being the thief. And worse yet, the real thieves are after him as well. And when Paxton falls into their clutches, he'll face a difficult choice: give up the jewels, or risk brutal torture and certain death!<br /><br />Richard Marsh was a versatile writer of ghost stories, horror novels, and romances, as well as thrilling mysteries like ""The Datchet Diamonds"" (1898).

40376,14297258,Cork: Its Origin and Industrial Uses,Gilbert Erwin Stecher,"PREFACE THIS monograph is not an attempt to put before the reading public a scientific exposition of the merits and qualities of the Quercus Suber or Quercus Liber Linneus, and carry it up into the heights of learning where none but the learned may go but to set forth in as concise a manner as possible, the plain story of the corkwood stopper so well known to all. The corkwood as seen in the stopper and in many other articles of trade, has long been of service to man, and remained unnoticed in journals of science, but for a word here and there and in trying to acquaint myself with its gener- alities, found it most difficult to get even these. This rather impressed me as being singular, a material so largely used and so little to its credit, in literature, that I pressed my investigations only to find that the farther I searched the less I found. The few facts gleaned were of interest, and it occurred to me to put them together in some readable form, for future reference. But as I re- flected upon the unsuccessful attempt to get infor- mation, which was made in behalf of my studies, I promptly decided to go into the subject deep enough to cover all the facts and the result is this monograph Quercus Suber It is presented with the hope that it will help others who seek a knowledge of corkwood and is only intended as a resume of a very interesting sub- ject. I have endeavored to give credit to those to whom it is due and offer my results as a tribute to a material that stands in a class worthy of 4Jie scientists as well as the commercialists esteem.

The mysticism does not encompass its utility and general uses nor its native land, as these are well known, but is more associated with its character, composition and chemical makeup. Its uses may be traced far back into the misty past that is dim to us, but from the faint scroll of history looms up in the minds eye as an epoch that we may have been glad to know, and although the references are few, by carefully analyzing them we may glean somewhat of its lineage.",0.00,5:0|4:0|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:0,0,0,112,Delany Press,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1382938590l/14297258._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1382938590l/14297258._SY75_.jpg,1406783005,9781406783001,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14297258-cork

40388,2361524,"The Life of John Marshall, Volume 4",Albert J. Beveridge,"John Marshall (1755-1835) became the fourth chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court despite having had almost no formal schooling and after having studied law for a mere six weeks. Nevertheless, Marshall remains the only judge in American history whose distinction derives almost entirely from his judicial career. During Marshall's nearly 35-year tenure as chief justice, he wielded the Constitution's awe-inspiring power aggressively and wisely, setting the Supreme Court on a course for the ages by ensuring its equal position in the triumvirate of the federal government of the United States and securing its role as interpreter and enforcer of the Constitution. Marshall's judicial energies were as unflagging as his vision was expansive. This four-volume life of Marshall received wide acclaim upon its initial publication in 1920, winning the Pulitzer Prize that year, and makes fascinating reading for the lawyer, historian, and legal scholar.",4.00,5:1|4:0|3:1|2:0|1:0|total:2,0,0,704,Cosimo Classics,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1596051124,9781596051126,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2361524.The_Life_of_John_Marshall_Volume_4

This fact meant more than the five words usually imply, for to few spots did October show such a gracious presence as she did to this pretty town. Beautiful at all seasons, even in its wintry dress of gleaming snow, in its autumn gorgeousness, Riveredge was entirely irresistible. In summer the town drowsed, for during July and August many of its inhabitants took a holiday and journeyed thither and yonder; in the autumn it wakened to the busy bustle of active life and its preparations for the drawing together of all who dwelt therein, and spring was the time when it did its renovating, its housecleaning, its decorating, but October’s crisp westerly winds blowing across the broad expanses of the river set blood stirring, made pulses throb many beats quicker, and caused even strangers to smile and nod to one another as they passed along the streets.

Interpreting, differently from others, the much debated passage in which Plato describes the cosmical function of the Earth, I found it indispensable to give my reasons for this new view. But I soon discovered that those reasons could not be comprised within the limits of a note. Accordingly I here publish them in a this separate Dissertation. The manner in which the Earth’s rotation was conceived, illustrates the scientific character of the Platonic and Aristotelian age, as contrasted with the subsequent development and improvement of astronomy. <br />",0.00,5:0|4:0|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:0,0,0,,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21379728-plato-s-doctrine-respecting-the-rotation-of-the-earth-and-aristotle-s-c

Trusting that it will be received as such, and will be of some assistance to young anglers in cultivating that, which, we are assured by the highest authority on angling, is ""an art worth learning."" <br />In preparing this short treatise I have assumed, what is generally admitted by fishermen, that catching trout with an artificial fly is the highest branch of the piscatorial art; for, although some bottom-fishers and spinners claim that as much skill is required in their branch as is in fly-fishing, yet I think the palm must be yielded to the fly-fisher.

The chain of events surrounding this episode in U.S. history is revealed through the friendship between, Jeff, a local boy whose father is a camp administrator, and George, a Japanese American boy imprisoned in the camp.",2.50,5:0|4:0|3:1|2:1|1:0|total:2,2,0,32,August House Publishers,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,0874837596,9780874837599,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1793715.Under_One_Flag

Purchasers can download a free scanned copy of the original book (without typos) from the publisher. 1902. Not illustrated. Excerpt: ... chapter xxxiv the penitent hat the Marquis of Twickenham lives a religious X life is a matter of public notoriety. His benefactions to the Church whose faith he had adopted are in the mouths of every one. By far the larger portion of his income must, in some form or other, go into priestly hands. His family seat at Cressland is ordered almost as if it were a house of the religious. Priests are everywhere. Both a convent and a monastery have been established in the grounds. His days are ordered as if he himself were one of the brotherhood. Prayer and fasting are his rules of life. Strange stories are told of self-inflicted penances. Thus he seeks, it would seem, to atone for the sins of his early life. In the opinion of certain persons the penitential spirit came on him with altogether unexpected suddenness. Mr. Stephen Foster, who had charge of the family finances till they were transferred to the custody of Roman Catholic administrators, to this day cannot understand how the alteration came about. He declares that when the truant peer first returned from his prolonged absence, his lordship struck him as being very much more of a scoffer than a bigot. Yet all at once he was in sackcloth and ashes. Mr. Foster cannot make it out at all. He is persuaded that there is something curious somewhere. Lord Reginald Sherrington keeps a keen eye upon his brother's proceedings. His lordship's generosity has enabled him to marry Lady Violet Howarth, and it is understood that the match is, on the whole, a happy one; but he cannot rid himself of a feeling that the priestly element which rules at Cressland requires attention and constant observation. In which respect he is not impossibly correct. Miss Desmond is still unmarried. Douglas Howarth is dead.

40453,12710075,Tom Ossington's Ghost,Richard Marsh,"She went to a pile of music which was on a little table, for the purpose of selecting a piece of sufficient simplicity to enable a tyro to display his powers, or want of them. He was between her and the window. In passing the window he glanced through it. As he did so, he gave a sudden start--a start, in fact, which amounted to a positive jump. His hat dropped from his hand, and, wholly regardless that he was leaving it lying on the floor, he hurried backwards, keeping in the shadow, and as far as possible from the window. The action was so marked that it was impossible it should go unnoticed. It filled Madge Brodle with a sense of shock which was distinctly disagreeable. Her eyes, too, sought the window--it looked out on to the road. A man, it struck her, of emphatically sinister appearance, was loitering leisurely past. As she looked he stopped dead, and, leaning over the palings, stared intently through the window. It was true that the survey only lasted for a moment, and that then he shambled off again, but the thing was sufficiently conspicuous to be unpleasant.<br /><br />A Classic Mystery Story<br /><br /><i>This edition from New Century Books contains Direct link technology</i>",3.68,5:7|4:7|3:7|2:4|1:0|total:25,12,4,,,eng,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,2940013155138,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12710075-tom-ossington-s-ghost

Like Dracula and many of the sensation novels pioneered by Wilkie Collins and others in the 1860s, The Beetle is narrated from the perspectives of multiple characters, a technique used in many late 19th-century novels (those of Wilkie Collins and Stoker, for example) to create suspense and to confuse gender boundaries.",3.67,5:0|4:2|3:1|2:0|1:0|total:3,1,0,116,Emereo Classics,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1365398461l/17677386._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1365398461l/17677386._SX50_.jpg,1486439691,9781486439690,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17677386-frivolities---especially-addressed-to-those-who-are-tired-of-being-serio

Purchasers can usually download a free scanned copy of the original book (without typos) from the publisher. Not indexed. Not illustrated. 1906 edition. Excerpt: ...98, from Paris. ""Blond-haired brides, bondswomen both, carried ale to the barn; the casks were not turned with hands nor forged by hammers; she that made it strutted about outside the isle."" The answer is ""Eider-ducks' eggs"" (C. P., I, 89). The egg is also likened to a cask containing beer in a short riddle-rhyme which is current from Lapland to Hungary. In the Faroe Islands it takes this form: ""Bolli fell from the ledge, all its hoops fell off. There is no man in the East, there is no man in the West, who can restore it"" (M., p. 417). In Prussia they say: --Kommt ein Tonn aus Engelland, Ohne Boden, ohne Band; 1st zweierleai Bier drin. (Sim., p. 287.) ""A cask comes from Engelland, without bottom, without baud; it contains two kinds of beer.' Among ourselves there is no riddle-rhyme, as far as I know, which describes the egg as a cask containing beer. But in the seventeenth century the word Humpty-Dumpty was used to designate a drink which consisted of ale boiled in brandy,1 and this conception obviously hangs together with 1 Murray's Dictionary: Humpty-Dumpty, the two kinds of beer of the foreign riddlerhymes on the egg. Other riddle-rhymes current among ourselves or abroad describe the egg as a house or a castle. The following one describes it as an enigma in itself: --Aa I was going o'er London Bridge I saw something under a hedge; 'Twas neither fish, flesh, fowl, nor hone. And yet in three weeks it runned alone. (1846, p. 213.) Girls in America play a game called HumptyDumpiy. They sit on the ground with their skirts tightly gathered around them so as to enclose the feet. The leader begins some rhyme, all join in, and at a certain word previously agreed upon, all throw themselves backwards, keeping...",0.00,5:0|4:0|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:0,0,0,,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20568366-comparative-studies-in-nursery-rhymes
40458,22468378,The Real Jesus of the Four Gospels,J.B. Atwater,"The first part of this work is a collation of all that is said, and just what is said, in each of the four Gospels, regarding the more important incidents of Jesus' life. Every statement in the text, it is thought, is accurate, free from personal coloring or sectarian bias, and may be verified from the passages cited. After examining various lives of Jesus, harmonies of the Gospels, etc., there seemed to be need of such a work, which would furnish simply the facts, and leave the reader to form his own conclusions. Certain notes are appended in elucidation of or comment on the text, and these may be taken for what they are worth. Their underlying idea is, that the true greatness of Jesus lay in His being a human Teacher and not a Divine Redeemer, and therefore the supernatural parts of the Gospel story are not of vital importance. The King James version has been used, since that has been the Bible of English-speaking peoples up to the present century, and their conceptions of Jesus have been formed from it, and not from the revised version. The differences between the two versions are probably not material to any matter herein discussed. The second part is an attempt to point out, and comment on, the many and wide divergences that have grown up between the preachings of Jesus and the practices of His professed followers. Its object is not to criticise the short-comings of Christianity, but to bring home to the people of the world a realization of the practical effect which these divergences have had, and are now having, on political and economic questions of high import to the present and future welfare of mankind.",0.00,5:0|4:0|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:0,0,0,,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22468378-the-real-jesus-of-the-four-gospels

But with it as our basis we may now turn our attention to one of the most essential, but also one of the most difficult, tasks of the non miraculous history of creation, namely, to the actual con struction of the Organic Pedigree. Let us see how far we are already able to point out all the different organic forms as the divergent descendants of a single or of some few common original forms. But how can we construct the actual pedigree of the animal and vegetable group of forms from our knowledge Of them, at present so scanty and fragmentary? The answer to this question lies in what we have already remarked of the parallelism of the three series of development - in the important causal relation which connects the palaeontological development of all organic tribes with the embryological development of indi viduals, and with the systematic development of groups.<br /><br />About the Publisher<br /><br />Forgotten Books publishes hundreds of thousands of rare and classic books.

These stories are found, whether narrated at length, or sometimes only mentioned in a cursory and tantalising reference, from the earliest poets, Homer and Hesiod, through the lyric age, and the Attic renaissance of the fifth century, when they form the material of the tragic drama, down to the second century B. C., when Apollodorus, the Athenian grammarian, made a prose collection of them, which is invaluable. They reappear at Rome in the Augustan age (and later), in the poems of Vergil, Ovid, and Statius-particularly in Ovid's ""Metamorphoses. "" Many more are supplied by Greek or Roman travellers, scholars, geographers, or historians, of the first three centuries of our era, such as Strabo, Pausanias, Athenaeus, Apuleius and Aelian...",5.00,5:2|4:0|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:2,1,0,280,Dodo Press,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1409920496,9781409920496,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7363418-children-of-the-dawn

Γεννήθηκε και μεγάλωσε στο Αργοστόλι Κεφαλονιάς, όπου και εργάστηκε αρχικά ως γραφέας στο τελωνείο μέχρι το 1870, όπου μετεγκαταστάθηκε στην Αθήνα για να εργαστεί ως υπογραμματέας στην Εισαγγελία Αθηνών και για να επιδοθεί στη λογοτεχνία.Υπήρξε από τους ιδρυτές και μόνιμους συντάκτες της εφημερίδας ""Το Άστυ"" και αρχισυντάκτης της ""Καθημερινής"". Παράλληλα ασχολήθηκε με την ποίηση, την πεζογραφία, τη μετάφραση, την ιστοριογραφία και το δοκιμίο, ενώ έγινε ευρύτατα γνωστός για τα εύθυμα θεατρικά του έργα. Ενδεικτικό της επιτυχίας του είναι ότι το μονόπρακτο έργο του ""Ζητείται υπηρέτης"" επιλέχθηκε για την πρεμιέρα του Βασιλικού Θεάτρου το 1901. Επίσης, χάρη στην κωμική φλέβα του και τα αστεία λογοπαίγνιά του, διακρίθηκε στην συγγραφή επιθεώρησης: τα Παναθήναια (1907) (μουσική Θ. Σακελλαρίδη), σε συνεργασία με τον Γεώργιο Τσοκόπουλο, είχαν τόσο μεγάλη επιτυχία ώστε οδήγησε τους συγγραφείς στη δημιουργία των Νέων Παναθηναίων και σε μία μόνιμη συνεργασία (με την μετέπειτα προσθήκη στην ομάδα του Πολύβιου Δημητρακόπουλου).

40482,1105762,The Meaning Of Faith,Harry Emerson Fosdick,"Harry Emerson Fosdick was one of the most popular liberal preachers of the early twentieth century, and his The Meaning of Faith is considered by many one of the finest reconciliations of religious belief with modern scientific thought.

This thoughtful, friendly interpretation of the holy book of one of the world's dominant faiths is a powerful corrective to reflexively fundamental thinking... just as it was when it was first published in 1917. Also available from Cosimo Classics: Fosdick's The Manhood of the Master and The Meaning of Prayer. American theologian HARRY EMERSON FOSDICK (1878-1969) was born in New York, educated at Colgate and Columbia Universities, and served as professor of practical theology at Union Theological Seminary from 1915 to 1946.

""Juana, what mean you? Speak, girl! What have you heard? What have you seen?"" Juana's face had been white when she came bursting in upon her young mistress; she held her hand to her side; her breath came and went in great gasps; yet already she was recovering the power of speech, and she seized Inez by the arm. ""Mistress, they are below already; they are robbing the house. Can you not hear them? When they have taken the wine and the oil they will come hither and murder us!"" Inez held her breath to listen. Yes, there were sounds from below-sounds of voices-loud, threatening voices, and the laughter of men assured of victory. Juana, the maid, spoke in a fierce whisper. Fear was receding.

And there couldn't be a worse place to spend it than up on Anglezarke.<br /><br />Thomas Ward is the apprentice for the local Spook, who captures witches and drives away ghosts. As the weather gets colder and the nights draw in, the Spook receives an unexpected visitor. Tom doesn't know who the stranger is or what he wants, but the Spook suddenly decides it's time to travel to his winter house, Anglezarke. Tom has heard it will be a bleak, forbidding place, and that menacing creatures are starting to stir somewhere on the moors nearby.<br /><br />Can anything prepare Tom for what he finds there? What if the rumors about the evil beast called the Golgoth are true? And how much danger will Tom be in if the secrets the Spook has been trying to hide from the world are revealed?",4.14,5:10459|4:9153|3:4896|2:721|1:227|total:25456,21521,496,489,Greenwillow Books,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,0060766247,9780060766245,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/298568.Night_of_the_Soul_Stealer

The topic of the hour to-day has been a bit of a sermon from the text, "" And to every seed its own body,"" and the lesson embodied was that of Faith. The preaching came from a package of gladiolus bulbs, just received, and it run on this wise: Here are these dry bulbs, separately wrapped and labeled.

But there is nothing in form nor size to show that they will not develop precisely the same form and color of flower. I know that they will all reveal the leaf, habit of growth, bud and bloom that distinguishes this species of plant from all others, because I know (M) that these are gladiolus bulbs, and every seed hath its own body. A gladiolus bulb never yet produced a dahlia. A tigridia or shellflower bulb, though greatly resembling some gladiolus bulbs, and its form of leaf is very similar, yet it never produces a bud nor blossom like the gladiolus.

The Samoset River, winding down prettily through hills and sloping farm lands to the bay of the same name, gleamed in the sunlight, now with a polished surface like ebony in some sheltered inlet, or again sparkling with innumerable points of light where its surface was whipped up into tiny waves by a brisk moving wind. There had been rain for a few days before, and the weather was now clearing, with a smart westerly breeze that had come up in the morning, but was swinging in slightly to the southward. The great white cloud-banks had mostly passed on, and these were succeeded at present by swiftly moving clumps of smaller and lighter clouds, that drifted easily across the sky, like the sails below them over the surface of the water.</i>",0.00,5:0|4:0|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:0,0,0,,,eng,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19286190-the-rival-campers-afloat-or-the-prize-yacht-viking

And so, as it was now the time when the sun would have set upon the bay, if it had not been shut out from sight by a heavy mass of clouds, and as the wind came laden with rain, which dashed in the faces of those who were out-of-doors to encounter it, the boys turned from the spot where they had gathered and hurried for shelter, the brothers to their cottage, and Henry Burns to the hotel.",0.00,5:0|4:0|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:0,0,0,162,Tebbo,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1365396924l/17677320._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1365396924l/17677320._SX50_.jpg,1486439012,9781486439010,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17677320-the-rival-campers---or-the-adventures-of-henry-burns

CHAPTER V IONIAN OR ATHENIAN EDUCATION Let me now give an account of the Old Education, when I, uttering words of justice, was in my prime, and self-control was held in respect. In the first place, a child was not allowed to be heard uttering a grumble. Then all the boys of the quarter were obliged to march in a body, in an orderly way and with the scantest of clothing, along the streets to the music master's, and this they did even if it snowed like barley-groats. Then they were set to rehearse a song, without compressing their thighs, -- either ""Pallas, mighty city-stormer,"" or ""A shout sounding far,"" putting energy into the melody which their fathers handed down. And, if any one attempted any fooling, or any of those trills like the difficult inflexions a la Phrynis now in vogue, he received a good threshing for his pains, as having insulted the Muses. Again, at the physical trainer's, the boys, while sitting, were obliged to keep their legs in front of them. . . . And at dinner they were not allowed to pick out the best radish-head, or to snatch away anise or celery from their elders, or to gourmandize on fish and field-fares, or to sit with their legs crossed. . . . Take courage, young man, and choose me, the Better Reason, and you shall know how to hate the public square, to avoid the bath-houses, to be ashamed of what is shameful, to show temper when any one addresses you in ribald language, to rise from your seat when your elders approach, and not to be a lubber to your own parents, or to do any other unseemly thing to mar the image of Modesty, or to rush to the house of the dancinggirl, and, while you are gaping at her performances, get struck with an apple by a wench and fall from your fair fame, or to talk back to your father, ...",4.50,5:5|4:2|3:1|2:0|1:0|total:8,5,0,,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20323092-aristotle-and-ancient-educational-ideals

40569,7577357,Tales of Mean Streets,Arthur Morrison,"Arthur George Morrison (1863-1945) was an English author and journalist, known for his realistic novels about Londons East End and for his detective stories. In 1890 he left his job as a clerk at the Peoples Palace and joined the editorial staff of the Evening Globe newspaper. The following year he published a story entitled A Street which was subsequently published in book form in Tales of Mean Streets (1894). Around this time Morrison was also producing detective short stories which emulated those of Conan Doyle about Sherlock Holmes. Three volumes of Martin Hewitt stories were published before the publication of the novel for which Morrison is most famous: A Child of the Jago (1896). Other less well-received novels and stories followed, until Morrison effectively retired from writing fiction around 1913. Between then and his death, he seems to have concentrated on building his collection of Japanese prints and paintings. Amongst his other works are Martin Hewitt: Investigator (1894), Zig-Zags at the Zoo (1894), Chronicles of Martin Hewett (1895), Adventures of Martin Hewett (1896) and The Hole in the Wall (1902).",3.71,5:12|4:26|3:15|2:4|1:2|total:59,36,3,120,Dodo Press,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1409941728,9781409941729,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7577357-tales-of-mean-streets

40590,21361822,A Century of Science and Other Essays,John  Fiske,"Dear Tom, -It has long been my wish to make you the patron saint or tutelar divinity of some book of mine, and it has lately occurred to me that it ought to be a book of the desultory and chatty sort that would remind you, in your present exile at the world's eastern rim, of the many quiet evenings of old, when, over a tankard of mellow October and pipe of fragrant Virginia, while Yule logs crackled blithely and the music of pattering sleet was upon the window-pane, we used to roam in fancy through the universe and give free utterance to such thoughts, sedate or frivolous, as seemed to us good. I dare say the present volume may serve as an epitome of many such old-time sessions of sweet discourse, which I trust we shall by and by repeat and renew. But there is one link of association which in my mind especially connects you with the present occasion. My theory of the causes and effects of the prolongation of human infancy, with reference to the evolution of man, was first published in the ""North American Review"" for October, 1873, when you were the editor of that periodical. The article, which was entitled ""The Progress from Brute to Man,"" was made up of two chapters of my ""Outlines of Cosmic Philosophy"" (part ii. chaps, xxi., xxii.), which was published a year later, in October, 1874. The value of the theory therein set forth was at once recognized by many leading naturalists. In the address of Vice-President Edward Morse, before the American Association, at its meeting at Buffalo in 1876, my theory receives extended notice as one of the most important contributions yet made to the Doctrine of Evolution; and it is declared that I have given ""for the first time a rational explanation of the origin and persistence of family relations, and thence communal relations, and, finally, of society.""",3.00,5:0|4:0|3:1|2:0|1:0|total:1,0,0,,,eng,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21361822-a-century-of-science-and-other-essays
40591,16130,Alexander Hamilton,Ron Chernow,"Pulitzer Prize-winning author Ron Chernow presents a landmark biography of Alexander Hamilton, the Founding Father who galvanized, inspired, scandalized, and shaped the newborn nation.<br /><br />In the first full-length biography of Alexander Hamilton in decades, Ron Chernow tells the riveting story of a man who overcame all odds to shape, inspire, and scandalize the newborn America. According to historian Joseph Ellis, <b>
  <i>Alexander Hamilton</i>
</b> is “a robust full-length portrait, in my view the best ever written, of the most brilliant, charismatic and dangerous founder of them all.”<br /><br />Few figures in American history have been more hotly debated or more grossly misunderstood than Alexander Hamilton. Chernow’s biography gives Hamilton his due and sets the record straight, deftly illustrating that the political and economic greatness of today’s America is the result of Hamilton’s countless sacrifices to champion ideas that were often wildly disputed during his time. “To repudiate his legacy,” Chernow writes, “is, in many ways, to repudiate the modern world.” Chernow here recounts Hamilton’s turbulent life: an illegitimate, largely self-taught orphan from the Caribbean, he came out of nowhere to take America by storm, rising to become George Washington’s aide-de-camp in the Continental Army, coauthoring The Federalist Papers, founding the Bank of New York, leading the Federalist Party, and becoming the first Treasury Secretary of the United States.Historians have long told the story of America’s birth as the triumph of Jefferson’s democratic ideals over the aristocratic intentions of Hamilton. Chernow presents an entirely different man, whose legendary ambitions were motivated not merely by self-interest but by passionate patriotism and a stubborn will to build the foundations of American prosperity and power. His is a Hamilton far more human than we’ve encountered before—from his shame about his birth to his fiery aspirations, from his intimate relationships with childhood friends to his titanic feuds with Jefferson, Madison, Adams, Monroe, and Burr, and from his highly public affair with Maria Reynolds to his loving marriage to his loyal wife Eliza. And never before has there been a more vivid account of Hamilton’s famous and mysterious death in a duel with Aaron Burr in July of 1804.<br /><br />Chernow’s biography is not just a portrait of Hamilton, but the story of America’s birth seen through its most central figure. At a critical time to look back to our roots, <b>

No aludo al hecho de que algunas cocineras tengan sobre el fogon tal cual novela para honesta distraccion del espiritu atribulado y grasiento. Me refiero a lo que se ha escrito de poco tiempo a esta parte sobre materias culinarias. No es facil enumerar todos los tratados de cocina y reposteria y los manuales del arte de guisar que han sido publicados, y mucho menos las recetas sueltas que andan por ahi[1]. Lo que si puede asegurarse es que los autores que han explotado todas estas materias se han revestido de la mayor seriedad para redactar sus trabajos y ofrecerselos al publico que come bien, que es el mas sano de todos los publicos, o al menos lo debe ser. A la tal seriedad es precisamente a lo que yo pretendo sacar punta en estas cortas pero honradas lineas, sin que el hacerlo sea faltar al respeto que los principales guisanderos teoricos me infunden, unos por sus meritos y otros porque desgraciadamente hicieron tiempo ha la ultima digestion de su vida. Yo no soy cocinero, y apenas si he tenido roce, (roce tecnico, se entiende), con cocinera alguna; pero como suelo sentir comezon de poner en solfa las cosas mas graves, me permito presentarte, caro lector, un librito humoristico de cocina, menos caro que tu y sin mas pretensiones que ensenarte a confeccionar algunos platos de cocina y de reposteria, ya montados, ora de a pie, y entretenerte con varias poesias relativas a la manducatoria. Mas no debo dejar paso franco a las recetas ni a las coplas sin consignar antes unas cuantas advertencias respecto a lo que en clase de comensal bien nacido debes hacer antes de comer y durante la comida; si, durante ese acto importantisimo que, digan lo que quieran los inapetentes de profesion, constituye, sin duda, el segundo de los placeres con que contamos los mortales en este valle de lagrimas y de patatas fritas.",0.00,5:0|4:0|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:0,0,0,,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1499238677l/35591875._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1499238677l/35591875._SX50_.jpg,1548483664,9781548483661,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35591875-cocina-comica

In Excuse Me, Your Life Is Waiting, she says that what actually molds every moment of every day of one's life are feelings. Using a candid, witty approach to a genre riddled with self-important puffery, she shows how feelings - not positive thinking, or sweat and strain, or good or bad luck, or even smarts - set the tone for people's lives.

40618,121732,Surprised by Joy: The Shape of My Early Life,C.S. Lewis,"<i>Surprised by Joy: The Shape of My Early Life</i> is a partial autobiography describing Lewis' conversion to Christianity. The book overall contains less detail concerning specific events than typical autobiographies. This is because his purpose in writing wasn't primarily historical. His aim was to identify &amp; describe the events surrounding his accidental discovery of &amp; consequent search for the phenomenon he labelled ""Joy"". This word was the best translation he could make of the German idea of Sehnsucht, longing. That isn't to say the book is devoid of information about his life. He recounts his early years with a measure of amusement sometimes mixed with pain. <br /><br />However, while he does describe his life, the principal theme of the book is Joy as he defined it. This Joy was a longing so intense for something so good &amp; so high up it couldn't be explained with words. He's struck with ""stabs of joy"" throughout life. He finally finds what it's for at the end. He writes about his experiences at Malvern College in 1913, aged 15. Though he described the school as ""a very furnace of impure loves"" he defended the practice as being ""the only chink left thru which something spontaneous &amp; uncalculating could creep in."" The book's last two chapters cover the end of his search as he moves from atheism to theism &amp; then from theism to Christianity. He ultimately discovers the true nature &amp; purpose of Joy &amp; its place in his own life. <br /><br />The book isn't connected with his unexpected marriage in later life to Joy Gresham. The marriage occurred long after the period described, though not long after the book was published. His friends were quick to notice the coincidence, remarking he'd really been ""Surprised by Joy"". ""Surprised by Joy"" is also an allusion to Wordsworth's poem, ""Surprised by Joy-Impatient As The Wind"", relating an incident when Wordsworth forgot the death of his beloved daughter.",4.08,5:19253|4:15212|3:7702|2:1976|1:1273|total:45416,42299,1141,185,,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1381407473l/121732._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1381407473l/121732._SY75_.jpg,0006280838,9780006280835,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/121732.Surprised_by_Joy
40619,6816776,"Camilla; Or, a Picture of Youth, Volume V",Fanny Burney,"Frances Burney (1752-1840), also known as Fanny Burney and after marriage as Madame D'Arblay, was a novelist, diarist, and playwright. She was self-educated, and began writing what she called her ""scribblings"" at the age of ten. She destroyed the manuscript of her first novel, but her journals survived. In 1793 she married a French exile, General Alexandre D'Arblay. Their only son, Alexander, was born in 1794. After a lengthy writing career, and travels that took her to France for over ten years, she settled in Bath, England. Throughout her career as a writer, her wit and talent for satirical caricatures were widely acknowledged. In total, she wrote four novels, eight plays, one biography, and twenty volumes of journals and letters. Her works include: The History of Caroline Evelyn (1767), Evelina; or, The History of a Young Lady's Entrance into the World (1778), Cecilia; or, Memoirs of an Heiress (1782), Camilla: or, A Picture of Youth (1796) and The Wanderer; or, Female Difficulties (1814).",4.50,5:1|4:1|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:2,2,0,272,Dodo Press,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1409915867,9781409915867,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6816776-camilla-or-a-picture-of-youth-volume-v

Purchasers can usually download a free scanned copy of the original book (without typos) from the publisher. Not indexed. Not illustrated. 1898 edition. Excerpt: ... CHAPTER VI. DEPOSED. The little sound that is as common as silence--a familiar step, a murmured word, an opening door--one hears it a thousand times with contented indifference, as one hears the singing of the tea-kettle. But one day it falls on the heart as well as on the ear, like the stroke of a swift sword. It seems exactly the same, but one knows at once that it is not the same. In the twentieth part of a second one recognises the voice of a dire calamity--especially if one is a mother, and has heard it before. Tom came into the house by way of the kitchen, and I heard him say to Jane, in quite a quiet tone, ""Where's Mrs. Braye?"" That was all. I sprang from my chair, wild with terror, dropping my needlework to the floor. For I knew--I knew--I didn't want to be told--that something had happened to Harry. My boy! my boy! I had been scolding him, only an hour ago, for making love to Lily's governess--a minx, whom I had just requested to find another situation--and he had slammed the door almost in my face on leaving me. I had been longing for Tom to come in, that I might tell him all about it, and have a little cry on his shoulder, and my dignity and authority in the house supported; but now that he was here my tongue was paralysed. And I had no grievance, but an immeasurable remorse. ""Don't be frightened,"" said my husband, trembling, in a would-be off-hand voice, ""it's nothing very serious--just a bad shaking--I told him that new mare of his wasn't to be trusted, and there was a nasty stone just where she threw him. He's stunned a bit, that's all --no bones broken. I have sent for the doctor. Now look here, Polly"" He opened his arms across the doorway, but I broke through them furiously.

40672,21218089,The White Virgin,George Manville Fenn,"It was a long, thin, white finger, one which had felt the throbbing of hundreds and thousands of pulses, and Doctor Praed, after viciously flicking at a fly which tried persistently to settle upon his ivory-white, shiny, bald head, hooked that finger into Clive Reed's button-hole, just below the white rosebud Janet had given him a little earlier in the evening. ""Mind the flower."" ""All right, puppy. Come here. I want to talk to you."" ""About Janet?"" ""Pish! mawkish youth. Great ugly fellow like you thinking of nothing else but Janet. Wait till you've been her slave as I have for eighteen years."" ""Pleasant slavery, Doctor,"" said the young man, smiling, as he allowed himself to be led out on to the verandah just over the gas-lamp which helped to light up Great Guildford Street, W.C. ""Is it, sir? You don't know what a jealous little she-tartar she is."" ""I warn you I shall tell her every word you say, Doctor. But it's of no good. I shall not back out. Look at her dear face now."" Reed caught the little Doctor by the shoulder, and pointed to where his daughter sat with the light of one of the shaded lamps falling upon her pretty, animated face, as she laughed at something a sharp-looking, handsome young man was saying-an anecdote of some kind which amused the rest of the group in old Grantham Reed's drawing-room. ""Oh yes, she's pretty enough,"" said the Doctor testily. ""I wish she weren't. Don't let that brother of yours be quite so civil to her, boy. I don't like Jessop.""",3.00,5:0|4:0|3:1|2:0|1:0|total:1,1,0,,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21218089-the-white-virgin

What's the good of being sorry? You know how I suffer from indigestion, and yet you persist in giving me eggs like that for my breakfast."" Mr Ralph Elthorne, of Hightoft, in the county of Lincolnshire, threw down the knife with which he had given a savage chop at the side of an egg, as if to cut off the top at a blow, pushed away his plate so that the silver egg-cup fell over sidewise, finishing the breaking of the egg, and letting a thick stream of rich yellow yolk begin to flow, while the irritable gentleman made a snatch at the toast-rack, and uttered an angry ejaculation. ""Will you take tea or coffee, papa, dear?"" said the sweet, rather delicate looking girl seated at the head of the table; but there was no reply, and after exchanging glances with the lady, a good-looking, sun-tanned young fellow on her right said: ""Let me send you some of this, father,"" and he ""made an offer"" at the hot water dish before him with a glistening spoon. ""Eh? What is it, Al?"" ""Kidneys, sir."" ""Bah! No, I've got leather enough here. Look at this. Does that idiotic woman in the kitchen call this dry toast? Look at it. Only fit to make soles for shooting boots."" ""Rather caky,"" said the young man, with his mouth full. ""Not bad kidneys; nice and hot."" ""Well, Isabel, how long am I to wait for that cup of coffee? No, I'll take tea."" The girl, who had poured out two cupfuls tentatively, started up from her chair, and took the cup of tea round to the other end of the table, placed it beside the rather fierce looking elderly man, bent down and kissed his forehead, and hurried back to her place.",4.50,5:1|4:1|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:2,2,0,,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21051936-nurse-elisia

40686,18924553,Demonology and Devil-lore,Moncure Daniel Conway,"Written in the 19th century, this lengthy and thorough text documents the various manifestations of demons and devils in the Christian religion. The forms they take, and the means by which they appear in the physical world, are cataloged. How they correspond to actual phenomena, such as death and pestilence, is likewise noted. Conway draws upon various writings within the Biblical scriptures, together with later works published in the Middle Ages and subsequent centuries, to arrive at his own comprehensive treatment of the subject. <br /><br />The second volume of the work concerns devils. Various figures such as Ahriman and Viswámitra receive chapters, in which the writings about them are quoted to form a complete image of their behavior and meanings. Appearances of devils in later works, such as the diabolical Mephistopheles in Goethe's Faust, are also cataloged. <br /><br />The overarching aim of Conway's thesis is to draw parallels between the various demonic and devilish phenomena, while noting their overall influence across the history of Christianity. The text is informative in tone and does not stray to dogmatism; Conway instead provides sourced information in a factual, studied tone. <br /><br />For his part, Conway was not a believer in the lore of demons. Although he served variously as a Methodist, Unitarian and Freethought minister in life, he had little time for the supernatural elements of Christianity. It is thus that Demonology and Devil-lore is an effort toward debunking and discounting what Conway viewed as the fantastical elements of a faith he otherwise identified with spiritually and morally. <br /><br />Today, Demonology and Devil-lore is somewhat archaic in terms of tone owing to its age. However, it still counts among the most thorough, in-depth and wide-ranging treatments of a subject which has fascinated religious and non-religious persons alike for centuries.",3.52,5:38|4:32|3:44|2:22|1:6|total:142,127,4,,,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1506141772l/18924553._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1506141772l/18924553._SX50_.jpg,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18924553-demonology-and-devil-lore

Numerous carriages, also, some with coronets on their panels, and powdered footmen behind, rolled up from Cheapside.

The Cubs wonder if perhaps the old Indian is responsible for the carved face on the cliff.

40733,24178943,Im Frühling sterben,Ralf Rothmann,"»Sprach ich meinen Vater in der Kindheit auf sein starkes Haar an, sagte er, das komme vom Krieg; man habe sich täglich frischen Birkensaft in die Kopfhaut gerieben. Ich fragte nicht weiter nach, hätte wohl auch, wie so oft, wenn es um die Zeit ging, keine genauere Antwort bekommen. Die stellte sich erst ein, als ich Jahrzehnte später Fotos von Soldatengräbern in der Hand hielt und sah, dass viele Kreuze hinter der Front aus jungen Birkenstämmen gemacht waren.« Im Frühling sterben ist die Geschichte von Walter Urban und Friedrich – »Fiete« – Caroli, zwei siebzehnjährigen Melkern aus Norddeutschland, die im Februar 1945 zwangsrekrutiert werden. Während man den einen als Fahrer in der Versorgungseinheit der Waffen-SS einsetzt, muss der andere,Fiete, an die Front. Er desertiert, wird gefasst und zum Tod verurteilt, und Walter, dessen zynischer Vorgesetzter nicht mit sich redenlässt steht plötzlich mit dem Karabiner im Anschlag vor seinem besten Freund ... In eindringlichen Bildern erzählt Ralf Rothmann vom letzten Kriegsfrühjahr in Ungarn, in dem die deutschen Offiziere ihren Männern Handgranaten in die Hacken werfen, damit sie noch angreifen, und die Soldaten in der Etappe verzweifelte Orgien im Angesicht des Todes feiern. Und wir erleben die ersten Wochen eines Friedens, in dem einer wie Walter nie mehr heimisch wird und noch auf dem Sterbebett stöhnt: »Die kommen doch immer näher, Mensch! Wenn ich bloß einen Ort für uns wüsste ...«",3.78,5:242|4:500|3:339|2:58|1:12|total:1151,346,38,233,Suhrkamp Verlag,ger,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1419893098l/24178943._SY160_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1419893098l/24178943._SY75_.jpg,3518424750,9783518424759,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24178943-im-fr-hling-sterben

40745,4662,The Short Stories,F. Scott Fitzgerald,"Today, F. Scott Fitzgerald is known for his novels, but in his lifetime, his fame stemmed from his prolific achievement as one of America's most gifted (and best-paid) writers of stories and novellas. <br /><br />In 'The Short Stories of F. Scott Fitzgerald', Matthew J. Bruccoli, the country's premier Fitzgerald scholar and biographer, assembles a sparkling collection that encompasses the full scope of Fitzgerald's short fiction. <br /><br />The forty-three masterpieces range from early stories that capture the fashion of the times to later ones written after the author's fabled crack-up, which are sober reflections on his own youthful excesses. <br /><br />Included are classic novellas, such as ""The Rich Boy,"" ""May Day,"" and ""The Diamond as Big as the Ritz,"" as well as a remarkable body of work he wrote for the Saturday Evening Post and its sister ""slicks."" <br /><br />These stories can be read as an autobiographical journal of a great writer's career, an experience deepened by the illuminating introductory headnotes that Matthew Bruccoli has written for each story, placing it in its literary and biographical context.<br /><br />Together, these forty-three stories compose a vivid picture of a lost era, but their brilliance is timeless. <br /><br />This essential collection is a monument to the genius of one of the great voices in the history of American literature.",4.23,5:6130|4:5089|3:2006|2:332|1:102|total:13659,12000,162,800,Scribner,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1400891315l/4662._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1400891315l/4662._SY75_.jpg,0684842505,9780684842509,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4662.The_Short_Stories

40751,29280037,My Old Man and the Mountain: A Memoir,Leif Whittaker,"In 1963, the world followed the first American Mount Everest Expedition, and watched as ""Big Jim"" Whittaker became the first American to stand on top of the world. He returned home a hero. <br /><br />My Old Man and the Mountain is Leif Whittaker's engaging and humorous story of what it was like to ""grow up Whittaker""―the youngest son of Jim Whittaker and Dianne Roberts, in an extended family of accomplished climbers. He shares glimpses of his upbringing and how the pressure to climb started early on. Readers learn of his first adventures with family in the Olympic Mountains and on Mount Rainier; his close yet at times competitive relationship with his brother Joss; his battle with a serious back injury; and his efforts to stand apart from his father's legacy. With wry honesty he depicts being a recent college grad, still living in his parents' home and trying to find a purpose in life―digging ditches, building houses, selling t-shirts to tourists―until a chance encounter leads to the opportunity to climb Everest, just like his father did. <br /><br />Leif heads to Nepal with all the excitement, irony, boredom, and trepidation that are part of high-altitude climbing. Well-known guides Dave Hahn and Melissa Arnot figure prominently in his story, as does ""Big Jim."" But Leif's story is not his father's story. It's a unique coming of age tale on the steep slopes of Everest and a climbing adventure that lights the imagination and fills an emotional human endeavor with universal meaning.<br /><br />""Whittaker writes as he climbs mountains, with courage, grace, and a dash of humility. The result is an utterly compelling tale of a young man who bravely tackles two great challenges--one made of rock and ice and one made of doubts and fears. Its's a great read."" --Daniel James Brown, author of The Boys in the Boat. <br /><br />""Leif Whittaker, son of the first American to summit Everest, has given us a deliciously irreverent perspective on growing up in the shadow of a famous father, and how that journey helped shape a unique perspective on one young man's own relationship with a mountain...and a dad."" --Tom Hornbein, author of Everest: The West Ridge. <br /><br />""It might be easy to feel lost in the shadow of a father who was the first American to stand on top of Mount Everest. Leif Whittaker tells the unique story of finding his own identity--as a son, and as a climber--with humility, candor, and a wonderful sense of humor."" --Brendan Leonard, author of Sixty Meters to Anywhere.",4.26,5:78|4:69|3:26|2:0|1:2|total:175,145,22,,,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1469737084l/29280037._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1469737084l/29280037._SX50_.jpg,1680510681,9781680510683,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29280037-my-old-man-and-the-mountain

40759,39338545,Murder on the Old Bog Road,David  Pearson,"<b>A woman is found dead in a ditch. As the list of suspects grows, a town’s dirty secrets are revealed. </b> <br /> <br />It’s a cold winter evening and rain is sweeping in from the Atlantic when a young woman, having braved the weather to visit her sick mother in <b> a remote part of Ireland </b>, comes across an obstacle in the road. She clears the highway of stones from a damaged bridge only to see the <b>body of a woman</b> in a ditch. With no phone reception, she travels to the nearest police station to report what she has found. <br /> <br />The local Garda waste no time in attending the scene of the crime. The woman is clearly dead, but it needs proper <b>forensics to establish if foul play </b> was the cause. In the meantime, is it not possible that the woman driver was in fact the culprit? She is clearly not telling the whole truth. <br /> <br />A game of cat and mouse ensues when <b>the inquiry is upgraded to a murder investigation</b>. The trouble is, when the victim is recognised as a sex worker, there is <b>no shortage of possible suspects</b>. And few of them, if any, are willing to tell the truth to the police. It will take all of Galway detectives Hays and Lyons’ experience to cut through the web of lies and <b>identify the killer in their midst</b>. <br /> <br />MURDER ON THE OLD BOG ROAD is the first in a series of atmospheric crime fiction titles featuring Detective Inspector Mick Hays and Detective Sergeant Maureen Lyons. The second book, UNEQUAL SHARES, will be released in April, 2018. MURDER ON THE OLD BOG ROAD will appeal to fans of Val McDermid, Stuart McBride and Pete Brassett. <br /> <br />",3.62,5:403|4:531|3:500|2:186|1:55|total:1675,1671,74,,The Book Folks,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39338545-murder-on-the-old-bog-road
40760,22718186,"Fifty Years in Chains; Or, The Life of an American Slave",Charles   Bell,"Fifty Years in Chains; Or, The Life of an American Slave by Charles Bell<br /><br />Entered according to Act of Congress in the year 1858 <br /><br />The story which follows is true in every particular. Responsible citizens of a neighboring State can vouch for the reality of the narrative. The language of the slave has not at all times been strictly adhered to, as a half century of bondage unfitted him for literary work. The subject of the story is [was] still a slave by the laws of this country, and it would not be wise to reveal his name.<br /> <br />Chapter 1. Separated from My Mother.<br /><br />My story is a true one, and I shall tell it in a simple style. It will be merely a recital of my life as a slave in the Southern States of the Union--a description of negro slavery in the “model Republic.”<br /><br />My grandfather was brought from Africa and sold as a slave in Calvert county, in Maryland. I never understood the name of the ship in which he was imported, nor the name of the planter who bought him on his arrival, but at the time I knew him he was a slave in a family called Maud, who resided near Leonardtown. My father was a slave in a family named Hauty, living near the same place. My mother was the slave of a tobacco planter, who died when I was about four years old. My mother had several children, and they were sold upon master’s death to separate purchasers. She was sold, my father told me, to a Georgia trader. I, of all her children, was the only one left in Maryland. When sold I was naked, never having had on clothes in my life, but my new master gave me a child’s frock, belonging to one of his own children. After he had purchased me, he dressed me in this garment, took me before him on his horse, and started home; but my poor mother, when she saw me leaving her for the last time, ran after me, took me down from the horse, clasped me in her arms, and wept loudly and bitterly over me. My master seemed to pity her, and endeavored to soothe her distress by telling her that he would be a good master to me, and that I should not want anything. She then, still holding me in her arms, walked along the road beside the horse as he moved slowly, and earnestly and imploringly besought my master to buy her and the rest of her children, and not permit them to be carried away by the negro buyers; but whilst thus entreating him to save her and her family, the slave-driver, who had first bought her, came running in pursuit of her with a raw-hide in his hand. When he overtook us, he told her he was her master now, and ordered her to give that little negro to its owner, and come back with him.<br /><br />My mother then turned to him and cried, “Oh, master, do not take me from my child!” Without making any reply, he gave her two or three heavy blows on the shoulders with his raw-hide, snatched me from her arms, handed me to my master, and seizing her by one arm, dragged her back towards the place of sale. My master then quickened the pace of his horse; and as we advanced, the cries of my poor parent became more and more indistinct--at length they died away in the distance, and I never again heard the voice of my poor mother. Young as I was, the horrors of that day sank deeply into my heart, and even at this time, though half a century has elapsed, the terrors of the scene return with painful vividness upon my memory. Frightened at the sight of the cruelties inflicted upon my poor mother, I forgot my own sorrows at parting from her and clung to my new master, as an angel and a saviour, when compared (Continued...)",4.25,5:2|4:1|3:1|2:0|1:0|total:4,4,0,,,eng,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22718186-fifty-years-in-chains-or-the-life-of-an-american-slave

40771,265986,Darkness Spoken: The Collected Poems of Ingeborg Bachmann,Ingeborg Bachmann,"<i>Darkness Spoken</i> gathers together Ingeborg Bachmann’s two celebrated books of poetry, as well as early and late poems not collected in book form, over 100 of them appearing in English for the first time, as well as 25 poems never before published in German. Bachmann is considered one of the most important poets to emerge in postwar German letters, and this volume represents the largest collection available in English translation. Influencing numerous writers from Thomas Bernhard to Christa Wolf to Elfriede Jelinek (winner of the 2004 Nobel Prize in Literature), Bachmann’s poetic investigation into the nature and limits of language in the face of historical violence remains unmatched in its ability to combine philosophical insight with haunting lyricism.<br /><br />Bachmann was born in 1926 in Klagenfurt, Austria. She studied philosophy at the universities of Innsbruck, Graz, and Vienna. In 1953 she received the poetry prize from Gruppe 47 for her first volume, <i>Borrowed Time</i> (<i>Die gestundete Zeit</i>). Her second collection, <i>Invocation of the Great Bear</i> (<i>Anrufung des großen Bären</i>), appeared in 1956. Her various awards include the Georg Büchner Prize, the Berlin Critics Prize, the Bremen Award, and the Austrian State Prize for Literature.

40776,25569768,Poor Folk in Spain,Jan   Gordon,"Excerpt from Poor Folk in Spain <br />We had tasted Spain before ever we had crossed her frontiers. Indeed, perhaps Spain is the easiest country to obtain samples from without the fatigue of travelling. The Spaniard carries his atmosphere with him: wherever he goes he re-creates in his immediate surroundings more than a hint of his national existence. The Englishman abroad may be English - more brutally and uncompromisingly English than the Spaniard is Spanish - yet he does not carry England with him. He does not, that is, re-create England to the extent of making her seem quite real abroad; there she appears alien, remote, somewhat out of place. So, too, neither the Russian, the German, the Dane, the Portuguese, the Italian, nor the American can carry with him the flavour of his homeland in an essence sufficiently concentrated to withstand the insidious infiltration of a foreign atmosphere. To some extent the Scandinavian countries, Norway and Sweden, have this power; but Spain is thus gifted in the greatest measure. These three countries seem to possess a national unconsciousness which fends them off from too close a contact with lands which are foreign to them; perhaps one might almost accuse them of a lack of sensitiveness in certain aspects... <br />However, be the reason what it may, we had gathered some experience of Spain in Paris before, and in London during the war.",4.00,5:0|4:1|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:1,1,0,,,eng,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1171491069,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25569768-poor-folk-in-spain

40786,2134411,The Black Riders and Other Lines,Stephen Crane,"Stephen Crane (1871-1900) was an American novelist, poet and journalist. He is best known for his novel Red Badge of Courage (1895). The novel introduced for most readers Crane's strikingly original prose, an intensely rendered mix of impressionism, naturalism and symbolism. He lived in New York City a bohemian life where he observed the poor in the Bowery slums as research for his first novel, Maggie: A Girl of the Streets (1893), a milestone in uncompromising realism and in the early development of literary naturalism. He became shipwrecked in route to Cuba in early 1897, an experience which he later transformed into his short story masterpiece, The Open Boat (1898). Crane's poetry, which he called 'lines' rather than poems, was also strikingly new in its minimalist meter and rhyme. It employed symbolic imagery in order to communicate at times heavy-handed irony and paradox. Other works include Active Service (1899), The Monster (1899), The Blue Hotel (1899), Whilomville Stories (1900) and Wounds in the Rain (1900).",4.16,5:93|4:62|3:27|2:14|1:2|total:198,144,15,100,Yalebooks,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1557092110l/2134411._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1557092110l/2134411._SX50_.jpg,189317302X,9781893173026,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2134411.The_Black_Riders_and_Other_Lines

Such were the lives of Lord Edward Cecil, his wife Violet and Alfred Milner with whom she fell in love. Edward Cecil, a younger son of the great Lord Salisbury, married Violet Maxse in 1894, at Britain's imperial zenith. During the Boer War, as Chief Staff Officer to Baden-Powell, he was besieged at Mafeking. While in Cape Town Violet, young, attractive and enterprising, fell in love with Alfred Milner, the High Commissioner responsible for British policy and began a love affair with him which was to last all their lives. happy years. Imperial Marriage is a portrait of a family, a marriage and an age now gone for ever. With its brilliant evocations of late Victorian and Edwardian aristocracy it brings to life one of the most significant periods of British history and takes the reader into the personal lives of those who sincerely believed that they had a manifest destiny to carry British rule every corner of the world.",3.67,5:1|4:2|3:3|2:0|1:0|total:6,4,1,320,Sutton Publishing Ltd,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1356475708l/3019943._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1356475708l/3019943._SY75_.jpg,0750937998,9780750937993,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3019943-imperial-marriage

So far as Maximina was concerned, he was sure of being happy. So far as he himself was concerned, he would do his best to be happy. Once and forever dispossessed of the vainglorious desire of ""making a brilliant marriage,"" he was convinced that no woman was better suited to him than this one. Never once did the fever of a hot and violent passion cause him any discomfort. The love that he felt was intense but calm; neither wholly spiritual, nor wholly material, but a union of both.

They were suggested by the tercentenary of the King James version of the Bible. The plan adopted led to a restatement of the history which prepared for the version, and of that which produced it. It was natural next to point out its principal characteristics as a piece of literature. Two lectures followed, noting its influence on literature and on history. The course closed with a statement and argument regarding the place of the Bible in the life of to-day.The reception accorded the lectures at the time of their public delivery, and the discussion which ensued upon some of the points raised, encourage the hope that they may be more widely useful.",4.25,5:2|4:1|3:1|2:0|1:0|total:4,1,2,286,Norwood Editions,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,0848217276,9780848217273,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/661357.The_Greatest_English_Classic

One of the first occult phenomena I remember, appeared to me when I was about five years of age. I was then living in a town in the West of England, and had, according to the usual custom, been put to bed at six o'clock. I had spent a very happy day, playing with my favourite toys-soldiers-and not being in the least degree tired, was amusing myself with planning a fresh campaign for the following morning, when I suddenly noticed that the bedroom door (which I distinctly remembered my nurse carefully latching) was slowly opening.

There’s a reason French is called “the language of love.”</i><br /><br />Lulu McQueen runs an exclusive honeytrap agency, designed to test the fidelity of rich men for their suspicious partners. While her business flourishes and track record in the field remains unbroken, her personal life isn’t so successful. <br /><br />One night, years ago, Lulu experienced bliss on a scale she’d never encountered before, with Luc, a charismatic, dominant, irresistible Frenchman. She fled in the morning, ashamed of herself, but her Parisian one-night stand was burned into her memories, ruining her for anyone else. <br /><br />When Lulu steps in to lure Mrs. Le Grand’s rich husband, for an exorbitantly high fee, she gets the shock of her life when she finds her mark at the hotel bar. Luc Le Grand still has a face and body to make Adonis weep. He exudes confidence, masculinity, and raw sex appeal.<br /><br /><b>The question now isn’t whether Lulu can tempt him, but whether she can resist him when she failed before.</b><br /><br />An Amazon bestselling erotic romance, The Temptress is a standalone novel, but can be read in conjunction with its companion book, All That Glisters, and their follow up novella, A Red Hot Christmas Paris. <br /><br />It was previously released with a different cover image.",4.45,5:198|4:83|3:29|2:9|1:2|total:321,0,1,,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1553433905l/44582501._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1553433905l/44582501._SX50_.jpg,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44582501-the-temptress

40846,19380,Candide,Voltaire,"<i>Candide</i> is the story of a gentle man who, though pummeled and slapped in every direction by fate, clings desperately to the belief that he lives in ""the best of all possible worlds."" On the surface a witty, bantering tale, this eighteenth-century classic is actually a savage, satiric thrust at the philosophical optimism that proclaims that all disaster and human suffering is part of a benevolent cosmic plan. Fast, funny, often outrageous, the French philosopher's immortal narrative takes Candide around the world to discover that -- contrary to the teachings of his distinguished tutor Dr. Pangloss -- all is not always for the best. Alive with wit, brilliance, and graceful storytelling, <i>Candide</i> has become Voltaire's most celebrated work.",3.76,5:56298|4:71073|3:53624|2:16656|1:5756|total:203407,176176,4673,129,Dover Publications,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1345060082l/19380._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1345060082l/19380._SY75_.jpg,0486266893,9780486266893,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19380.Candide

Excerpt: ... maims' Cathedrale; of regret, like Bazin's Terre qui Meurt; of unmoral pessimism, like De Maupassant's Bel-Ami; and the whole range of disquieting feminist fiction, --may turn out to be the most active social ferments and the real forerunners (little as their authors would wish it) of violent change, --of revolt and revolution! All contemporary fiction, in fact, has in it something of the doubt, the trouble, and the protest of the period; and, once upon this tack, nothing less than a minute examination of every novel and volume of short stories that has appeared since the FrancoPrussian war would be imposed. Of the essayists, critics, and philosophers who are more or less militant iconoclasts and revoltes, the most important are: --A. Ferdinand Herold, who expounds his attitude as follows: ""From the time I was able to think a little for myself, I have had an anarchist mind. I mean that I have always had a horror of undisputed authority, of dogmatism, and of conventional ideas, --ideas which, the greater part of the time, one does not attempt to justify to himself""; Camille Mauclair, who says: ""If anarchy is primarily the reform of ethics, in accordance with the principles of individualism, I can declare squarely that anarchy was born in me, with the study of metaphysics and the awakening of sensibility in the period when I began to know myself.... Furthermore, pity for the disinherited and execration of the spoliators is a point of honour for the few clean and upright people who are still to be found in the world""; Bernard Lazare, f who says: ""Authority, its value, and its raison d'etre are things which I have never been able to comprehend. That a man arrogate to himself the right to domineer over his fellows, in any fashion whatsoever, is still inconceivable ...",3.50,5:0|4:1|3:1|2:0|1:0|total:2,2,0,120,General Books,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1150582685,9781150582684,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9155787-paris-and-the-social-revolution-a-study-of-the-revolutionary-elements-i

Not for the ""real thing,"" be it understood, but for the quarterly practice laid down in the joint Naval and Military Regulations of 1917. Everything, thanks to a rigid administration, had hitherto proceeded with the regularity of clockwork; the Army officials were patting themselves on the back, the Naval authorities were shaking hands with themselves, and, in order to cement the bond of unity, each of the two Services congratulated the other. To the best of their belief they had reason to assert that Portsmouth was once more impregnable. A series of surprise torpedo-boat attacks upon the fortress had signally failed. The final test during the mobilization was to be in the form of a combined attack upon the defences by the battleships then lying at Spithead and the airships and aeroplanes stationed at Dover, Chatham, and Sheerness.",0.00,5:0|4:0|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:0,0,0,198,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1511534184,9781511534185,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27667004-the-rival-submarines

40868,9220284,A Midsummer Night's Dream,William Shakespeare,"Shakespeare's intertwined love polygons begin to get complicated from the start--Demetrius and Lysander both want Hermia but she only has eyes for Lysander. Bad news is, Hermia's father wants Demetrius for a son-in-law. On the outside is Helena, whose unreturned love burns hot for Demetrius. Hermia and Lysander plan to flee from the city under cover of darkness but are pursued by an enraged Demetrius (who is himself pursued by an enraptured Helena). In the forest, unbeknownst to the mortals, Oberon and Titania (King and Queen of the faeries) are having a spat over a servant boy. The plot twists up when Oberon's head mischief-maker, Puck, runs loose with a flower which causes people to fall in love with the first thing they see upon waking. Throw in a group of labourers preparing a play for the Duke's wedding (one of whom is given a donkey's head and Titania for a lover by Puck) and the complications become fantastically funny.",3.94,5:139085|4:148735|3:95977|2:23568|1:6747|total:414112,5,2,,,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9220284-a-midsummer-night-s-dream

40878,22749750,The Turner House,Angela Flournoy,"There ain't no haints in Detroit.<br /><br /><i>So spoke Francis Turner—patriarch and provider, former preacher and current truck driver—when his children claimed to have seen a ghost. A rising homeowner set to banish all the old ways for the promise of the new, Francis was having none of it. He and his wife worked hard to secure that house, to move up from Arkansas to Detroit, to make this life possible. He would not be haunted by the past.<br /><br />And so a myth was born, where any one of the Turners might later repeat that phrase and be telling about so much more than haints.</i><br /><br />The Turners live on Yarrow Street for over fifty years. Their house sees thirteen children get grown and gone—and some return; it sees the arrival of grandchildren, the fall of Detroit's East Side, and the loss of a father. Despite abandoned lots, an embattled city, and the inevitable shift outward to the suburbs, the house still stands. But now, as their powerful mother falls ill and loses her independence, the Turners might lose their family home. Beset by time and a national crisis, the house is worth just a tenth of its mortgage. The Turner children are called back to decide its fate and to reckon with how each of their pasts might haunt—and shape—their family's future.<br /><br />A major contribution to the literature on American families, <i>The Turner House</i> brings us a colorful brood full of love, pride, and unlikely inheritances. It's a striking examination of the American dream and a celebration of the ways in which our families bring us home.",3.63,5:2245|4:6261|3:4737|2:1028|1:255|total:14526,11453,1563,341,Houghton Mifflin Harcourt,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1408469614l/22749750._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1408469614l/22749750._SY75_.jpg,0544303164,9780544303164,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22749750-the-turner-house

But after the idealistic Felix Holt also returns to the town, the difference between Harold's opportunistic values and Holt's profound beliefs becomes apparent. Forthright, brusque and driven by a firm desire to educate the working-class, Felix is at first viewed with suspicion by many, including the elegant but vain Esther Lyon, the daughter of the local clergyman. As she discovers, however, his blunt words conceal both passion and deep integrity. Soon the romantic and over-refined Esther finds herself overwhelmed by a heart-wrenching decision: whether to choose the wealthy Transome as a husband, or the impoverished but honest Felix Holt.",3.68,5:939|4:1179|3:948|2:326|1:153|total:3545,3363,88,545,Penguin Classics,eng,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,0140434356,9780140434354,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/866301.Felix_Holt

40912,20178265,Pillar of Light (The Work and the Glory #1),Gerald N. Lund,"<i>""You believe me, don't you, Nathan."" It was not a question, but a statement, filled with wonder.<br /><br />It stunned Nathan.<br /><br />""You believe it all. I can see it on your face.""<br /><br />For a moment, time seemed suspended as Nathan probed the inward recesses of his soul. There was still the incredulousness, still the sense of hearing something that couldn't possibly be true. And yet he knew it was. He knew without the least shadow of doubt that everything Joseph was telling him was true. And so, finally, with a wonder of his own, he said, ""Yes, Joseph, I believe you.""<br /><br />Pillar of Light &amp;mdash</i>; the first volume in the series The Work and the Glory — begins the epic story of the Benjamin Steed family. In the 1820s they move from Vermont to Palmyra Township in upstate New York in search of better farmland. There they meet a young man named Joseph Smith and are thrown into the maelstrom of conflict and controversy that swirls around him. Did he really see the Father and the Son in a pillar of light? Has he truly been visited by angelic messengers? What is all this talk about gold plates and new scripture? In short, is he a prophet and seer or a monumental fraud? The answers each one gives to these questions — intensely personal, potentially divisive — will dramatically affect the lives of the Steeds forever after.<br /><br />Author Gerald N. Lund here masterfully weaves together historical reality and high-powered fiction. In his hands this combination seems to make the reader an eyewitness to the early scenes of the Restoration, thus deepening one's understanding and appreciation of those momentous events. The well-drawn plot and fictional characters present a moving, gripping story. Here are Benjamin and Mary Ann Steed, devoted to each other as man and wife, yet at odds over religion; Joshua, their volatile son, who rebels and heads for trouble; the sensitive Nathan, their second son, in whom Joseph Smith's message strikes a responsive chord; the beautiful Lydia McBride, who captures the hearts of both Joshua and Nathan.<br /><br />This book skillfully explores the inmost motivations of Joseph Smith and his early followers and the responses of typical contemporary families to the claims he made. These people come to life in this powerful historical novel, a story that captures both the heartache and the happiness that came in the wake of Joseph's experience with the pillar of light.",4.28,5:7308|4:5147|3:2005|2:350|1:127|total:14937,1313,75,,,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1462605727l/20178265._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1462605727l/20178265._SY75_.jpg,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20178265-pillar-of-light

Excerpt: ... section I history of stone-printing part I from 1796 to 1800 S my father, Peter Senefelder of Konigshofen in Franken, was Jljl court actor in Munich, I had ample opportunity in early youth to see and read many theatrical pieces. Thus I developed such a love for this branch of literature and for the theatre that I would have become an actor myself had I been permitted to obey my inclination. But my father, who was determined not to permit any of his children to choose the stage, compelled me to study law. I could satisfy my longings only occasionally by playing a few times in private theatricals and by venturing on a few dramatic writings in my hours of recreation. In my eighteenth year (1789) the question arose, at a gathering of youngsters, as to how we should entertain ourselves in the approaching Carnival time. We decided to give a little private play. Many pieces were proposed, but none seemed suitable, because each one wished to play a good and suitable part, and, besides, we could not fill most of the parts, as we lacked women. We were almost giving up hope when Herr Kuerzinger, now court actor, proposed to me to write a play, as I had begun one shortly before that happened to suit each of my friends. I finished the little piece, Die Madchen Kenner, in a short time. It was ready for production, when through accident we were disappointed about securing the private theatre on which we had counted. We were emboldened to request leave to produce it in the Kurfiirst's Court Theatre and succeeded, thanks to my father's aid. The over-kind praise which it won encouraged me to have the play printed. Although I was pretty generous with free copies among my friends, I received so much from Lentner, the book-dealer in Munich, that a net profit...",0.00,5:0|4:0|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:0,0,0,244,Gatfpress,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,0883622289,9780883622285,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15110909-the-invention-of-lithography

But the minute she walks out of her biotech firm accidentally carrying ""The Cure"" -- the most important scientific discovery of the century -- she's on the run from ruthless bioengineers, cops, and the U.S. government. Desperate to lose her trackers, Renee lays a full-body kiss on the first gorgeous guy she sees...a kiss that she gets back with a toe-curling vengeance. N.S.A. agent James Axelrod never thought apprehending his suspect would be so easy, and so sinfully arousing...or that he would consider taking her into custody in the privacy of his own bedroom...<br /><br /><b>Lovely Lies</b><br /><br />Peter Random lost everything when he was outwitted by that goody-goody Renee Jardin.

Cracking open his hard shell would be a real game, but Jimmy's more than Thea's match. He's got a few ideas for turning the tables on the brainy scientist...sensual, erotic fantasy ideas that just might change those letters in her name to ""Incredible,"" ""Insatiable,"" and ""Quivering with delight""...",3.42,5:102|4:176|3:233|2:96|1:13|total:620,577,29,294,Kensington,eng,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,075820647X,9780758206473,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/501435.Under_Cover

It is illustrated with 26 lithographs of watercolours by Robert Dudley, who also travelled with the expedition. The cable, constructed by the Telegraph Construction &amp; Maintenance Company, was designed to create a communications bridge between North America and Europe, enabling telegrams to be sent and received within minutes, when previously messages could be sent only by ship. The 1865 expedition was the fourth attempt to lay the cable, and although after 1200 miles the cable broke and was lost in the ocean, an expedition the following year was finally successful.

Highly original and imaginative, this debut novel raises questions about life, love, and the effects of time on relationships.<br /><br />Audrey Niffenegger’s innovative debut, <i>The Time Traveler’s Wife</i>, is the story of Clare, a beautiful art student, and Henry, an adventuresome librarian, who have known each other since Clare was six and Henry was thirty-six, and were married when Clare was twenty-three and Henry thirty-one. Impossible but true, because Henry is one of the first people diagnosed with Chrono-Displacement Disorder: periodically his genetic clock resets and he finds himself misplaced in time, pulled to moments of emotional gravity in his life, past and future. His disappearances are spontaneous, his experiences unpredictable, alternately harrowing and amusing. <br /><br /><i>The Time Traveler’s Wife</i> depicts the effects of time travel on Henry and Clare’s marriage and their passionate love for each other as the story unfolds from both points of view. Clare and Henry attempt to live normal lives, pursuing familiar goals—steady jobs, good friends, children of their own. All of this is threatened by something they can neither prevent nor control, making their story intensely moving and entirely unforgettable.",3.96,5:564325|4:479311|3:284893|2:93093|1:48429|total:1470051,660881,6409,500,Zola Books,eng,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1380660571l/18619684._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1380660571l/18619684._SX50_.jpg,,9781939126016,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18619684-the-time-traveler-s-wife

Tony Rossi yawned, stirred a little, then opened his black eyes and sat up quickly. With one motion he tossed the covers back and slid to the warm metal floor. He clicked off his alarm clock and hurried to the closet.<br />It looked like a nice day. The landscape outside was motionless, undisturbed by winds or dust-shift. The boy's heart pounded excitedly. He pulled his trousers on, zipped up the reinforced mesh, struggled into his heavy canvas shirt, and then sat down on the edge of the cot to tug on his boots. He closed the seams around their tops and then did the same with his gloves. Next he adjusted the pressure on his pump unit and strapped it between his shoulder blades. He grabbed his helmet from the dresser, and he was ready for the day.<br />In the dining-compartment his mother and father had finished breakfast. Their voices drifted to him as he clattered down the ramp. A disturbed murmur; he paused to listen. What were they talking about?

(1828-1912) began his career in the Public Record Office at 18 and retired as assistant keeper forty-seven years later. The author of numerous historical works, Gairdner is best-known for his archival and editorial work, which forms his most significant contributions to historical scholarship. He oversaw almost entirely the publication of Letters and Papers, Foreign and Domestic, of the Reign of Henry VIII. The Paston Letters represent a similarly important work. The Letters reveal the fortunes of the Norfolk Paston family and of their tumultuous time. Beginning in the reign of Henry V and continuing through the reigns of Edward IV, Richard III, and Henry VII, the Letters are of great interest to early modern historians and literary critics.

Purchasers can download a free scanned copy of the original book (without typos) from the publisher. 1895. Not illustrated. Excerpt: ... CHAPTER XLV. THE PRICE OF SILENCE. Along the broad Boulevard de la Republique the straight double row of gas-lamps that face the sea were already shedding their bright light, as Octave and I drove rapidly, having at last arrived at Algiers. Our toilsome journey over the sun-baked Desert from Agadez had occupied us nearly four weeks, and now, after twenty-four hours in an execrable railway carriage, we had arrived with aching bones, heads wearied, and thoroughly worn out by fatigue. Inquiries we made at Biskra, the point where we had first touched European civilization, showed that the prisoners, under a strong guard, had reached there and gone on by train to Algiers, thirteen days before our arrival. I saw, therefore, there was not a moment to lose. Zoraida was in deadliest peril, and I alone remained her friend. Through those long, weary, never-ending weeks, while we had been pressing onward over the glaring, monotonous plains, my thoughts had been constantly of her, and vainly did I endeavor, hour after hour, day and night, to devise some means by which I could effect her liberty. Tortured by gloomy apprehensions of her impending doom, meditating upon the hopelessness of the situation, and utter futility of attempting her release in face of the howling demand of the French colonists for exemplary punishment, I had journeyed onward, not knowing how to act. I had returned to Algiers to be near her, to hear the evidence at her trial, to--ah! I could not bear to contemplate the horrible moment!--to witness sentence passed upon her. Across the Place du Gouvernement our driver took us swiftly, shouting, as he cleared a way through the crowd of cosmopolitan promenaders, who, while enjoying the refreshing breeze, listened to popular operatic airs performed by the sple...",4.00,5:1|4:1|3:1|2:0|1:0|total:3,3,0,,General Books,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1151271683,9781151271686,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8046333-zoraida-a-romance-of-the-harem-and-the-great-sahara

41014,19910975,Abolition: A Sedition by a Northern Man,Geo W. Donohue,"We trust it will be obvious to all, that it was impossible to treat Abolitionism according to its merits, or to exhibit its true character, without regarding it as a religious movement. There are two prominent features of the moral and religious history of our country, with which we have been compelled to come in contact. We, therefore, take this opportunity so far to explain, as to bar the accident of being misapprehended. First, then, we have averred the philosophical connexion of antecedent and consequence between Abolitionism and violent reforms. It is proper, therefore, that we should state how much we are willing to be understood as meaning by this couplet of terms, having such a relation to the subject of this work. We say, then, that by violent reforms, we mean those religious and moral agitations of our country, which have proved alike unfriendly to religious and social order, which are generally disapproved by sober Christians, and we believe by the great majority of Christians, of all, or nearly all, denominations. It is possible, that on a single point we have hit hard a cherished opinion of many persons, for whom we have the greatest respect; but as it relates merely to a mode of action, we must claim to be indulged in our own opinion in that matter, as we allow the same privilege to others. In the next place, we have found it necessary, in the exhibit we have made of the political machinery of the Abolition movement, to enquire into its origin; and it will be manifest to all, that it was brought from the religious world. The fact, that the model of the American Anti-slavery Society was borrowed from the Religious and Benevolent Society system, could not implicate those institutions, in the estimation of the public, unless they should see fit to follow the same example, and so far as they might do it, by going over from the religious and moral, into the political sphere; which, we trust, they will be wise enough not to do. It was necessary to describe the machinery of those Societies in order to give the true picture of the one under particular consideration; but we have taken care at the same time to state, that the American Anti-slavery Society has betrayed and violated the principles of the Religious and Benevolent Society system, by first assuming its model, and then passing over into the field of political action. That all these machineries are well adapted to political ends, whenever they may be perverted and applied in that direction, it is unnecessary to say; and the only way to escape the charge, is to avoid the fault. The Abolition Society has gone openly into that field, on which account we have considered it fair and exactly true to represent it as a political organization, and as being necessarily such from the work it has taken in hand. Having, therefore, explained on these two points, we submit the work, without farther comment, to speak for itself.

The Metal Moon first appeared in the 1932 Winter issue of Wonder Stories Quarterly. The Metal Moon is a joint product of two imaginative minds, EVERETT C. SMITH and R. F. STARZL, in which we get a very unusual picture of some of the possibilities of interplanetary exploration. We know that as soon as interplanetary travel is possible, expeditions from the earth will be ranging the length and breadth of the solar system searching out the thousands of wonders that are to be discovered. It is quite possible that some of the explorers, whether through accident or desire, may colonize the other planets and develop under new and unusual conditions a new branch of the human race. It is doubtlessly true that if each of the solar planets were to be colonized, at the end of several hundred centuries there would be nine races of human beings who might differ radically from each other and in fact might not recognize each other as members of the same human stock. In this story we do not see nine races but we do see four of them and Mr. Starzl has united the four in a gripping narrative of the great spaces.",3.00,5:0|4:0|3:2|2:0|1:0|total:2,2,0,72,Spastic Cat Press,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1384023488l/17850014._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1384023488l/17850014._SX50_.jpg,1483701190,9781483701196,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17850014-the-metal-moon

41090,20776057,At the Sign of the Sword: A Story of Love and War in Belgium,William Le Queux,"Excerpt:<br />Warm, brilliant, and cloudless was the July noon. Beneath the summer sun the broad, shallow waters of the Meuse sparkled as they rippled swiftly onward through the deep, winding valley of grey rocks and cool woods on their way from the mountains of Lorraine, through peaceful, prosperous Belgium, towards the sea. That quiet, smiling land of the Ardennes was, in July in the year of grace 1914, surely one of the most romantic in all Europe-a green, peaceful land, undisturbed by modern progress; a land where the peasantry were still both honest and simple, retaining many of their primitive customs; a land where the herdsmen still called home the cattle by the blast of the horn as they had done for past centuries, where the feudal castles studding the country-mostly now in ruins-were once the abodes of robber-knights. In that long, deep green valley, which wound from Namur up past Dinant to the French frontier at Givet, the people had advanced but little. Legend and history, poetry and fiction, provoked an interesting reminiscence at almost every turn, for it was, indeed, a land that fascinated those used to the mad hurry of our modern money-making life.",3.00,5:0|4:0|3:1|2:0|1:0|total:1,1,0,,,eng,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,,,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20776057-at-the-sign-of-the-sword

Southampton was Jellicoe's birthplace, and he came of the race that the sea breeds.

41129,37822619,Astroball: The New Way to Win It All,Ben Reiter,"When <i>Sports Illustrated</i> declared on the cover of a June 2014 issue that the Houston Astros would win the World Series in 2017, people thought Ben Reiter, the article's author, was crazy. The Astros were the worst baseball team in half a century, but they were more than just bad. They were an embarrassment, a club that didn't even appear to be trying to win. The cover story, combined with the specificity of Reiter's claim, met instant and nearly universal derision. But three years later, the critics were proved improbably, astonishingly wrong. How had Reiter predicted it so accurately? And, more important, how had the Astros pulled off the impossible?<br /><br /><i>Astroball</i> is the inside story of how a gang of outsiders went beyond the stats to find a new way to win--and not just in baseball. When new Astros general manager Jeff Luhnow and his top analyst, the former rocket scientist Sig Mejdal, arrived in Houston in 2011, they had already spent more than half a decade trying to understand how human instinct and expertise could be blended with hard numbers such as on-base percentage and strikeout rate to guide their decision-making. In Houston, they had free rein to remake the club. No longer would scouts, with all their subjective, hard-to-quantify opinions, be forced into opposition with the stats guys. Instead, Luhnow and Sig wanted to correct for the biases inherent in human observation, and then roll their scouts' critical thoughts into their process. The numbers had value--but so did the gut.<br /><br />The strategy paid off brilliantly, and surprisingly quickly. It pointed the Astros toward key draft picks like Carlos Correa and Alex Bregman; offered a path for developing George Springer, Jos� Altuve, and Dallas Keuchel; and showed them how veterans like Carlos Beltr�n and Justin Verlander represented the last piece in the puzzle of fielding a championship team.<br /><br />Sitting at the nexus of sports, business, and innovation--and written with years of access to the team's stars and executives--<i>Astroball</i> is the story of the next wave of thinking in baseball and beyond, at once a remarkable underdog story and a fascinating look at the cutting edge of evaluating and optimizing human potential.",4.32,5:974|4:766|3:241|2:36|1:4|total:2021,1574,194,235,Crown Archetype,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1524453232l/37822619._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1524453232l/37822619._SY75_.jpg,0525576649,9780525576648,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37822619-astroball

It required no summons to be issued by the queen next morning in order to assemble her followers. They were on deck immediately after breakfast, long before the queen made her appearance, anxiously waiting to hear more of the tale. Therefore, when her Majesty made her appearance, Ingomar was at once requested to proceed, which he did without preliminaries. ""Incidents apparently trifling oftentimes shape our destiny. But in making this statement I do not mean to convey +he impression that I am about to describe a trifling incident, but the insignificant circumstances which caused the incident are what I refer to. Had it not been for an old bob-tailed, one-eyed, stray dog that happened to take a fancy to Lottie, and concluded to cast his destiny with her, there would have been-no use telling this story. Old Bob was fond of chasing rabbits. One day he started one; the rabbit ran for life; Bob ran for the rabbit. The rabbit ran in a certain direction; Bob ran in the same direction; he followed the rabbit, and we followed him; while doing so we came to a gravel pit, which gravel pit I am sure we never would have seen had Bob not started the rabbit; but as he did start it, thereby causing us to go to the gravel pit, I shall proceed to tell what followed. A large number of men were shoveling the gravel onto flat cars, to be hauled on the line of the railroad for ballasting the track. The rabbit took refuge in a hollow tree near where the men were at work; they came and cut the tree down and caught the rabbit. We sat down near the gravel pit to rest; the foreman invited us to ride on the gravel train to the next station, which was directly on our road. We were delighted at the prospect of a ten-mile ride on the cars, and what made it most desirable was the ...",4.33,5:2|4:0|3:1|2:0|1:0|total:3,3,3,,General Books,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1150635185,9781150635182,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9401794-the-white-rose-of-memphis-a-novel

41136,20872152,A Plucky Girl,L.T. Meade,"""I was born a month after my father's death, and my mother called me after him. His name was John Westenra Wickham, but I was Westenra Wickham alone. It was a strange name for a girl, and as I grew up people used to comment on it. Mother loved it very much, and always pronounced it slowly. She was devoted to father, and never spoke of him as most people do of their dead, but as if he were still living, and close to her and to me. When a very little child, my greatest treat was to sit on her knee and listen to wonderful stories of my brave and gallant father. He was a handsome man and a good man, and he must have possessed, in a large degree, those qualities which endear people to their fellows, for surely it was no light cause which made my mother's beautiful brown eyes sparkle as they did when she spoke of him, and her whole face awake to the tenderest life and love and beauty when she mentioned his name. I grew up, therefore, with a great passionate affection for my dead father, and a great pride in his memory.

The many thousands of books in our collection have been sourced from libraries and private collections around the world.The titles that Trieste Publishing has chosen to be part of the collection have been scanned to simulate the original. Our readers see the books the same way that their first readers did decades or a hundred or more years ago. Books from that period are often spoiled by imperfections that did not exist in the original. Imperfections could be in the form of blurred text, photographs, or missing pages. It is highly unlikely that this would occur with one of our books. Our extensive quality control ensures that the readers of Trieste Publishing's books will be delighted with their purchase. Our staff has thoroughly reviewed every page of all the books in the collection, repairing, or if necessary, rejecting titles that are not of the highest quality. This process ensures that the reader of one of Trieste Publishing's titles receives a volume that faithfully reproduces the original, and to the maximum degree possible, gives them the experience of owning the original work.We pride ourselves on not only creating a pathway to an extensive reservoir of books of the finest quality, but also providing value to every one of our readers.

No course was too grand, no driving range too humble for a stop on Hallberg's unpredictable tour of America's verdant and not-so-verdant golf venues. He tackled Kiawah Island's diabolical and breathtaking Ocean Course with a party of well-heeled Southern gents. He tromped through sagebrush roughs and kikuyu bunkers in the Nevada outback. He encountered the ghost of a cherished golfing buddy during a memorable round in the Smokies. And between games he nursed his wounds, pondered his constantly mutating handicap, and commiserated with fellow golfers in dusky sports bars, greasy spoons, and rain-soaked motel parking lots.

The older hands in these days are not easily caught by such a trick, and the High Command refuses to count any victims so claimed unless the performance is verified by independent witnesses either on the ground or aloft. Another point of interest in von Richthofen's fighting methods is that he states, that as a rule, he opens fire at 50 yards. Distances are hard to judge in the air. The pilot is more likely to underestimate them than otherwise, just as one does in judging distances at sea. But von Richthofen is probably as good a judge as any, and in this he seems to be stating a plain fact. In these days 50 yards is fairly long range. Some of our own crack fighters prefer 50 feet, if they can get into their favorite positions. Anyhow he shows the unwisdom of opening fire at 1,000 yards, as some inexperienced and excited machine-gunners are rather apt to do.[...].",3.33,5:0|4:1|3:2|2:0|1:0|total:3,3,0,122,Createspace,,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1444648644l/26768058._SX98_.jpg,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1444648644l/26768058._SX50_.jpg,150755804X,9781507558041,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26768058-the-red-battle-flyer

41187,922862,A House to Let,Charles Dickens,"<div>
  <div>Compiled by Charles Dickens, and including chapters by Elizabeth Gaskell, Wilkie Collins and Adelaide Anne Procter, <i>A House to Let</i> is a composite tale of mystery and intrigue set amid the dark streets of Victorian London. Advised by her doctor to have a change of scenery, the elderly Sophonisba takes up lodgings in London. Immediately intrigued by a nearby “house to let,” she charges her two warring attendants, Trottle and Jarber, to unearth the secret behind its seeming desertedness. Rivals to the end, they each seek to outdo the other to satisfy their mistress’ curiosity; however, it is only after repeated false starts—and by way of elaborate tales of men lost at sea, circus performers, and forged death certificates—that they happen upon the truth. Charles Dickens is one of England’s most important literary figures. His works enjoyed enormous success in his day and are still among the most popular and widely read classics of all time.</div>

The subject in this series of handbooks will be treated from the chemical rather than the engineering standpoint. The industrial aspect will also be more prominent than that of the laboratory. Each volume will be complete in itself, and will give a general survey of the industry, showing how chemical principles have been applied and have affected manufacture. The influence of new inventions on the development of the industry will be shown, as also the effect of industrial requirements in stimulating invention. Historical notes will be a feature in dealing with the different branches of the subject, but they will be kept within moderate limits. Present tendencies and possible future developments will have attention, and some space will be devoted to a comparison of industrial methods and progress in the chief producing countries.

He began his professional life while still in his teens, as his father's chief assistant engineer on the Thames Tunnel, and remains famous for projects including the Clifton Suspension Bridge and the SS Great Eastern. This study by his elder son, who was assisted in technical details by his engineer brother and by colleagues of their father, was published in 1870. The opening and closing chapters discuss Brunel's childhood and his private life, but the main body of the book presents Brunel's work thematically, with sections on bridges, railways, steamships, and dock and pier works. In all these areas Brunel was an innovator, pioneering the use of new materials and revolutionising early Victorian transport networks.

41222,16277782,Captain Paul Watson: Interview with a Pirate,Paul   Watson,"<b>
  <i>The behind-the-scenes true story of Paul Watson, the world's most famous eco-pirate and marine animal rights activist.</i>
</b><br /><br />Paul Watson became an animal rights activist at the young age of eleven, in 1962. When trappers killed a beaver that Paul had befriended, he systematically and efficiently located and destroyed their traps. This was the beginning of fifty years of animal rights activism. Among the international awards and recognition he has earned in that time, <i>Time Magazine</i> named Watson one of the top twenty environmental heroes of the 20th century.<br /><br />In 1969, when just eighteen, Watson co-founded Greenpeace. He was also the first man to intervene between a whale and a harpoon. Watson left Greenpeace to establish the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, which uses more aggressive direct-action strategies to combat threats to the world's ocean creatures. With a goal of protection and conservation of marine mammals, their first priority is ending the illegal hunting of seals and whales. In Antarctica, Japanese whalers kill hundreds of whales each year. To circumvent the moratorium on commercial whaling, Tokyo disguises their whaling under the cover of scientific programs. Yet the environmental movement got results: Japanese whalers, who intended to kill 850 minke whales, returned with only 507 whales in 2010. The International Court of Justice was asked to require Japan to end this whaling program, and the campaigns have included sinking ten illegal whaling ships, ramming more at sea, confiscating hundreds of long lines and drift nets and making more than 250 expeditions worldwide to save hundreds of thousands of marine animals.<br /><br />Captain Watson, though fighting for a good cause, is labeled by some as a ""pirate"" and an ""eco-terrorist,"" including those running Greenpeace today. But for those who think that petitions and banners will not be enough to save the ocean, he is a hero. To all his detractors, Paul Watson responds, ""Find us a whale that disapproves of our actions and we promise to give it up!""<br /><br />In this book, Paul Watson reveals to shipmate Lamya Essemlali his motivations, campaigns, dangers and successes. Watson was recently arrested in Germany on a Costa Rican warrant that claimed he endangered the crew of a fishing vessel a decade ago.

41241,27589898,The Progress Of The Marbling Art From Technical Scientific Principles: With A Supplement On The Decoration Of Book Edges,Josef Halfer,"Thank you for checking out this book by Theophania Publishing. We appreciate your business and look forward to serving you soon. We have thousands of titles available, and we invite you to search for us by name, contact us via our website, or download our most recent catalogues. No product finds so many and ample applications as color. Nearly every trade requires it for the decoration of its products so as to adapt them more generally and pleasantly to the present demands. The art of marbling is that branch of our trade, in which color is brought into use for the decoration of bindings, yet it has not found the desirable general introduction into our book-binderies because practical men have not so intently employed their time and endeavors, to overcome the difficulties, which resist its general application. Who could solve easier and more correctly than the mechanics, to whom these difficulties and obstacles offer themselves in practice? He is the only one to find the remedy, scientific men not possessing sufficient technical knowledge. Only he is ready and able to stand up for such special trades, to work and to fight for them, who is himself interested and who not only learned to understand the art of marbling from former instructions and traditions, but from his own practical experience. To him only, will it be possible to gain by close study true points, on which to further develop the whole subject. My original plan was, not only to remove the technical difficulties of the art of marbling, but also to ascertain the correct colors from the mass at present manufactured, for the purpose of manufacturing marbling colors. But in this I did not succeed as easily as I expected. Every color manufactory possesses another system to produce its products, and after thousands of experiments I was finally forced to resort to chemistry for the purpose of gaining a knowledge of the raw products viz: earths, metals, acids, bases and their conditions and qualities in order to study their compositions and precipitations, the coloring composite of lake colors and their bodies, and to subject them to investigation on their effects on marbling size. This was a tiresome work which demanded much patience and pertinacity. During these investigations, I have learned to know the influence of sizing upon colors and how it hindered or expedited a beautiful marbling or comb edging.",0.00,5:0|4:0|3:0|2:0|1:0|total:0,0,0,98,Createspace Independent Publishing Platform,,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png,https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/50x75-a91bf249278a81aabab721ef782c4a74.png,1503050475,9781503050471,https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27589898-the-progress-of-the-marbling-art-from-technical-scientific-principles

41248,22573272,With the Zionists in Gallipoli,John Henry Patterson,"This historic book may have numerous typos and missing text. Purchasers can usually download a free scanned copy of the original book (without typos) from the publisher. Not indexed. Not illustrated. 1916 edition. Excerpt: ... CHAPTER IV FORMATION OF THE ZION MULE CORPS From the days of my youth I have always been a keen student of the Jewish people, their history, laws and customs. Even as a boy I spent the greater part of my leisure hours poring over the Bible, especially that portion of the Old Testament which chronicles battles, murders, and sudden deaths, little thinking that this Biblical knowledge would ever be of any practical value in after life. It was strange, therefore, that I, so imbued with Jewish traditions, should have been drawn to the land where the Pharaohs had kept the Children of Israel in bondage for over four hundred years; and it was still more strange that I should have arrived in Egypt just at the psychological moment when General Sir John Maxwell, the Commander-in-Chief, was looking out for a suitable officer to raise and command a Jewish unit. Now, such a thing as a Jewish unit had been unknown in the annals of the world for some two thousand years--since the days of the Maccabees, those heroic Sons of Israel who fought so valiantly, and for a time so successfully, to wrest Jerusalem from the grasp of the Roman legions. It had happened that there had come down to Egypt out of Palestine many hundreds of people who had fled from thence to escape the wrath of the Turks. These people were of Russian nationality but of Jewish faith, and many of them strongly desired to band themselves together into a fighting host and place their lives at the disposal of England, whom the Jews have recognised as their friend and protector from time immemorial.

There are many reasons for keeping alive the remembrance of such heroic deeds. It is due to the memory of those men who took their lives in their hands, and, in many cases, laid their bones in the desert; it is an act of gratitude on our part, who have entered on their labours; and it is a kind of information indispensable to every Australian who desires to know the history of his country. And yet there is great danger of their being practically forgotten. The time when the harvest of discovery was reaped has faded into the past, and a generation is growing up not well informed on these most interesting adventures and achievements. Nor are the sources of information easily obtainable by those who purposely put themselves on the search. The journals of the explorers, never too plentiful, have now become scarce. They are only occasionally met with in private hands, where they are, for good reasons, held as a treasure. A considerable number of these works are to be found in the Sydney School of Arts, but they have been withdrawn from circulation, and are now kept for special reference only, in a glass case, under lock and key. <br />About the Publisher <br />Forgotten Books publishes hundreds of thousands of rare and classic books.
